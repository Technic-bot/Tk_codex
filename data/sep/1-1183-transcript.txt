Trace: Where‚Ä¶ am I?
Trace: (thoughts) I feel like I should know this place‚Ä¶ but why?
Trace: (thoughts) Wait a minute‚Ä¶ Who am I?!Flora: HELP!
Trace: Eh?!
Trace: What was that? Sounds like someone‚Äôs in trouble.
Trace: A girl?
Trace: Well, I won‚Äôt know anything sitting here. I have a feeling I‚Äôll need this, though.
Narration: In the forest‚Ä¶
Bandit (Ephemural): Hey, little Keidran.
Bandit (Ephemural): Looks like you‚Äôre in a lot of trouble.
Bandit (Ephemural): These are human lands‚Ä¶
Bandit (Ephemural): And your head‚Äôs worth quite a lot here. You‚Äôd be amazed what they‚Äôd pay for a hide like yours.Trace: Hey, leave her alone!
Flora: !
Trace: (thoughts) Great, now what do I do? I don‚Äôt even know if I can use this sword! And what is this girl, anyways?
Bandit (Ephemural): Hey, what the hell do you think you‚Äôre doing? I saw it first, and‚Ä¶ wait‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre‚Ä¶
Bandit (Ephemural): Y-you‚Äôre the Grand Templar!
Trace: Uh‚Ä¶ I am?Bandit (Ephemural): My apologies, Master Templar. I didn‚Äôt realize it was you. The Keidran‚Äôs all yours. Goodbye, Trace.
Trace: Uh‚Ä¶ bye‚Ä¶
Bandit (Ephemural): Be careful around that one, though. You may want to dispatch her quickly. She can be vicious.
Trace: !
Trace: V-vicious?
Bandit (Ephemural): Yes, good. This may work out after all.
Bandit (Ephemural): Taking his memories was a stroke of genius.
Mary (Ephemural): My enemy has become my greatest asset. What better way to protect the girl than with the human‚Äôs own weapon?
Mary (Ephemural): Now I just wait‚Ä¶
Mary (Ephemural): ‚Ä¶and hope they don‚Äôt kill each other‚Ä¶ just yet‚Ä¶Trace: Hey, there! Are you alright? Don‚Äôt worry, that guy won‚Äôt hurt you now.
Trace: (thoughts) Jeez, what am I doing? That guy said this thing is dangerous.
Trace: (thoughts) But‚Ä¶ though she looks like an animal‚Ä¶ I get the feeling she‚Äôs intelligent as well. Hope she doesn‚Äôt attack me‚Ä¶
Trace: (thoughts) Well, she isn‚Äôt responding to anything I‚Äôve said to her. Maybe she isn‚Äôt intelligent.
Trace: (thoughts) But I still won‚Äôt hurt her for no reason. It just wouldn‚Äôt be right‚Ä¶
Trace: (thoughts) I‚Äôll just leave her here. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll be fine on her own.
Trace: See you later‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ whatever you are.
Flora: ?
Flora: üíß
Flora: NYA!
Trace: Blarg!TWOKINDS
CHAPTER ONETrace: We‚Äôve been walking around for about five hours. Whatever this thing is, it seems to want to follow me. I hope this path leads to a town or city of some kind.
Trace: How are you holding up?
Flora: ‚Ä¶
Flora: Nya‚Ä¶
Trace: That‚Äôs good, hopefully we‚Äôll‚Äî
Trace: Woah!
Flora: Snerk‚Ä¶
Flora: Mrahahaha~!Trace: Well, it‚Äôs getting kinda late. We should camp out here for tonight.
Trace: According to this map, we‚Äôre near a town. We should be able to reach it by tomorrow.
Trace: Well, what do you think?
Trace: Sound good to‚Äî ack!Trace: (thoughts) Okay, relax‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs just an animal‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶a naked one‚Ä¶
Flora: Nya?
Flora: Erm‚Ä¶ sorry. This shirt gets kinda uncomfortable against my fur after a while‚Ä¶ Trace.
Trace: !!
Trace: Eep!
Trace: You‚Ä¶ can talk?
Flora: I‚Ä¶ thought you knew that‚Ä¶
Trace: (thoughts) I guess I should have‚Ä¶ She‚Äôd been responding to me like she knew what I was saying.
Trace: (thoughts) But I wonder if being intelligent makes her even more dangerous?Trace: Well‚Ä¶ as I was saying, we could make it to this town here to pick up supplies‚Ä¶ And maybe I can find out who I am‚Ä¶
Flora: No.
Trace: What? Why not? It seems like a reasonable plan‚Ä¶
Flora: ‚Ä¶
Flora: Grrrrrr‚Ä¶
Trace: Hey! What‚Äôs wrong?
Flora: I said no! I won‚Äôt let you take me to your city, human!
Trace: Oh crap‚Ä¶Trace: Woah, hold on! I didn‚Äôt mean anything! You don‚Äôt have to go if you don‚Äôt want to! Please, Flora‚Äî
Flora: Grrr!
Flora: Ah! How did you‚Ä¶ know my name?
Trace: Well, I‚Ä¶ Wait‚Ä¶ how did I know your name?
Trace: Oh, nevermind. What I‚Äôm saying is, I won‚Äôt force you to do anything. You don‚Äôt have to go with me. Now please, get up‚Ä¶
Flora: You‚Ä¶ promise?
Trace: I promise.
Flora: Thank you!
Trace: (thoughts) Not again!Trace: This is‚Ä¶ kinda awkward‚Ä¶ with you being naked‚Ä¶
Trace: Ehem, well‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôd better get the camp supplies.
Flora: ‚Ä¶
Trace: Uh oh‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ Flora?
Flora: Mrr?
Trace: We might have another problem‚Ä¶
Trace: I only have one blanket.Trace: Ah, I‚Äôm really tired. This is the first chance I‚Äôve had to sit down and think about what‚Äôs going on. Still no memories of my past.
Trace: Who am I‚Ä¶ how did I get here? And what is this weird girl? Maybe they‚Äôre normal around here‚Ä¶?
Trace: (thoughts) Well, I‚Äôm not getting anywhere. Maybe I‚Äôll find out more in the next town. That guy I met earlier seemed to know me. Was I important?
Trace: At least she‚Äôs asleep‚Ä¶
Flora: ‚Ä¶Trace: What‚Ä¶?
Trace: What is this place? Is this a dream?
Trace: Huh? Smoke?
Villager: Must‚Ä¶ get away! Please, help me! The Keidran‚Ä¶ someone help me!
Wolf: Die, Human!
Villager: No, wait, please!
Villager: Aaaaaaaaaah!
Trace: Aaah! ..uh‚Ä¶huff‚Ä¶Trace: (thoughts) What a strange dream‚Ä¶
Trace: Hey, Flo-? Where‚Äôd she go?
Trace: Flora? Flora!
Trace: (thoughts) Did she‚Ä¶ go back home? I guess it‚Äôs for the best, but still‚Ä¶
Trace: Flora?
Trace: What was that? Is that you up there, Flora?
Sythe: Not quite‚Ä¶Sythe: (in Keidran) Die, Human!
Trace: I‚Äôm screwed‚Ä¶
Trace: Ack! Stop! What are you doing?!
Trace: Oooph!
Trace: Erg‚Ä¶
Sythe: Hah, foolish Human. This is too easy!
Sythe: Taking Flora was a mistake! I‚Äôm going to enjoy ripping you to‚Äî
Sythe: Ack!
Trace: W-what happened? Wait, is that‚Ä¶
Trace: ‚Ä¶Flora?!
Flora: (in Keidran) Leave him alone, Sythe!
Narration: Feral FormSythe: What was that for?
Flora: What are you doing here? Everything‚Äôs under control!
Sythe: But I‚Ä¶ thought you were in trouble‚Äî
Flora: Well I‚Äôm not!
Trace: (thoughts) What are they saying? Well at least Flora seems to be holding her own.
Trace: (thoughts) Strange, that guy‚Äôs a lot bigger than her‚Ä¶ why is he afraid?
Sythe: But, Flora‚Ä¶
Flora: (in Human) If he gives me trouble, I‚Äôll just kill him myself!!
Trace: (in Human) K-kill me?!
Flora: Uh‚Ä¶ what language did I say that in again?Sythe: (in Keidran) Fine, I‚Äôll go.
Sythe: (in Keidran) But I hope you know what you‚Äôre doing. You know how dangerous the humans can be.
Flora: (in Keidran) I‚Äôll be alright. Now please go.
Flora: Well, that was easy enough! Are you okay, Trace?
Flora: ‚Ä¶Trace?
Trace: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fine‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶for now‚Ä¶
Trace: I-I‚Äôm glad you came when you did‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶unless you intend to kill me, too‚Ä¶
Trace: Well, I‚Äôm just gunna‚Ä¶ move over here for now‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶ cause any trouble‚Ä¶
Trace: Hm?
Flora: Nya!
Trace: Ah!Trace: Ah! What are you doing?
Flora: Trace, relax! I just said that stuff to get him to leave you alone.
Trace: Oh, I‚Ä¶ see‚Ä¶ who was that guy, anyway?
Flora: Oh, that was Sythe, my bodyguard‚Ä¶ and my fianc√©.
Trace: Fianc√©?
Flora: Yeah. We were in a caravan together when it was attacked.
Flora: He ran off and left me, until you saved me from the human.
Trace: But then‚Ä¶ why did he attack me?
Flora: But‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt you know?
Trace: Know what? I don‚Äôt remember anything up until yesterday.
Flora: Oh‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say‚Ä¶ our two races don‚Äôt usually get along.
Trace: Oh, I see‚Ä¶
Trace: But‚Ä¶ you wouldn‚Äôt attack me, right?
Flora: Not unless you give me a reason to!Trace: We‚Äôd better get going then. It‚Äôs already daytime.
Narration: Two hours later‚Ä¶
Trace: Hey Flora! It looks like this is the place.
Trace: Flora? What‚Äôs wrong?
Flora: Okay, we‚Äôre here. You go, I stay.
Trace: Wha‚Ä¶?
Trace: Flora, are you sure you don‚Äôt want to‚Äî?
Flora: Yes! I‚Äôm sure! Just go!
Trace: Do you want me to get you anything?
Flora: Sure, sure. But go now!2 - Twokinds ONLINE MANGA

TomArt StudiosTrace: Well, this looks like as good a place to get started as any.
[Inn]
Trace: Jeez, no wonder Flora didn‚Äôt want to come along. I wonder what they have against Keidran?
[No Keidran!]
Patron 1: Yes, I think you‚Äôll make a fine addition to the guide.
Karen: Hey, Trace!
Patron 2: A bottle of spirits, please.
Patron 3: So, what are you doing after work?
Karen: It‚Äôs been a long time! We thought you‚Äôd died.
Trace: Huh?
Karen: Trouble with the Keidran, again?
Trace: W-wait.. who are you?
Trace: Died?
Karen: Hey, Sis! Trace‚Äôs back!
Maren: Oh, is he now?
Trace: ‚Ä¶
Maren: ‚Ä¶Trace: Ow! What was that for?
Maren: You know darn well what that was for! Where have you been in the last month? Out hunting those blasted Keidran again, no doubt. But then you go missing and word goes ‚Äòround that you‚Äôre dead! Do you know how worried I was? As your girlfriend, I should know where you‚Äôre going.
Trace: But I don‚Äôt remem‚Äî hey!
Karen: Come on! There‚Äôs a bar fight going on! Let‚Äôs break it up!
Maren: What? Bar fight?!
Maren: HEY! You two get back here! I‚Äôm not done yelling!
Maren: !!
Red: Stupid animal. Don‚Äôt you know this is a human town?
Keith: I already told you! I‚Äôm not a Keidran!
Red: It doesn‚Äôt matter‚Ä¶
Red: You‚Äôre not human!Karen: Okay, go ahead. Break them up.
Trace: What?! Why me?
Red: (thoughts) That voice.. Could it be‚Ä¶?
Red: Tracy! You‚Äôre finally back! We thought you died! But ‚Äòo course, you can‚Äôt die!
Trace: (thoughts) Who are these people? And why did they all think I died?
Trace: ?
Red: I was just taking care of this animal here.
Trace: (thoughts) Hey, he looks kinda like Flora.
Keith: Wait!
Keith: You‚Äôre Trace Legacy?
Trace: That‚Äôs what everyone‚Äôs been telling me.
Keith: You‚Äôve got to help me!
Trace: Erk![ALL FIGHTS OUTSIDE]
Red: Twerp! I guess you‚Äôll want to take care of him yourself, right Trace?
Trace: Oh yeah, I‚Äôll ‚Äúhelp him out.‚Äù
Keith: Whimper
Trace: So, what can I do for you?
Keith: Huh?
Red: That‚Äôs not what I meant!Red: What the heck is wrong with Trace? He chose to side with that animal instead of me!
Maren: It‚Äôs like he has no memory of us! He‚Äôs not at all the same.
Karen: I kinda like this nicer Trace.
Red: What is that thing he‚Äôs talking to, anyway? It doesn‚Äôt look like a Keidran.
Maren: It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a Basitin, a different race that lives on an island, I think. It‚Äôs rare to see one around here.
Red: Grr, I bet one of them wiped his memory! Furry-eared freaks, I‚Äôll‚Äî
Karen: Ahem‚Ä¶
Red: Oh, Karen, you know I didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶ yours look good on you‚Äî Ah! Get her off of me! Ow, not there! Stop! Ack! Help, she‚Äôs biting me! Someone help! Aah!
Maren: Moron.Maren: Cut it out, you guys! We need to‚Äî
Maren: Hey! Where did they go?
Trace: So, what do you need my help with, Mr‚Ä¶?
Keith: Just call me Keith. My people need your help with a political problem.
Trace: Before you start, just to warn you, I think I have amnesia. I don‚Äôt remember much.
Keith: What? You don‚Äôt know anything?
Trace: Nothing since yesterday.
Keith: (thoughts) That would explain why he‚Äôs helping me so readily.
Keith: (thoughts) This could be easier than I thought.
Keith: No matter, we can still use your help. Can you travel with me to my city?
Trace: I‚Äôm sort of on an adventure already.
Keith: Then I will join you. We can travel to my city later. Gather any supplies you need and meet me by the town gates in an hour.
Trace: Um‚Ä¶ okay, I guess.Trace: Well, I‚Äôve gotten everything on the list. The only thing I haven‚Äôt bought yet is something for Flora‚Ä¶ What would a half cat half tiger-something want, anyway? Ball of yarn? But I wouldn‚Äôt want to insult her.
Trace: Hm‚Ä¶ maybe‚Ä¶
[Jewelry]
Sirus (Shopkeeper): Ah, a customer! Oh, the Grand Templar himself, I see!
Sirus (Shopkeeper): For what do I owe this honor?
Trace: I need to buy something for‚Ä¶ a girl.
Sirus (Shopkeeper): Oh?
Sirus (Shopkeeper): To win the favor of a Templar, she must be quite the fox!
Trace: (thoughts) No, more like tiger. But I guess I shouldn‚Äôt say that.Sirus (Shopkeeper): I have just the thing.
Sirus (Shopkeeper): This is a Subtleseed Crystal. Sure to woo any girl you might have your eye on.
Trace: Wow! It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ perfect!
Trace: How much is it?
Sirus (Shopkeeper): Oh, please. Who do you think I am? For you, Great Templar, no charge.
Trace: Wow, really? Thanks!
Sirus (Shopkeeper): Heh.
Sirus (Shopkeeper): Yes, well, good day to you. Have a pleasant journey, now.
Sirus (Shopkeeper): Pleasant journey, indeed.
Sirus (Shopkeeper): Heheheh‚Ä¶ hahah!
Shopkeeper: Mmph! Mmmph!Flora: Trace has been gone for a while. I hope he comes back.
Flora: Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I never should have let him go into the city, even if he has no memories!
Flora: Sigh! What am I doing?
Flora: I should be home, getting ready to be married!
Flora: But here I am, in a tree.
Flora: Hoping he doesn‚Äôt tell anyone I‚Äôm here.
Flora: I can just hope he comes back. I need him‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ I kinda‚Ä¶ miss him.
Flora: ‚Ä¶
Flora: Eh?!
Flora: What am I thinking?!Flora: I haven‚Äôt imagined anything like that since‚Ä¶ since I was a slave.
Trace: Flora?
Flora: Oh! It‚Äôs Trace! He actually came back! Thank goodness.
Trace: Flora?
Trace: I got all the supplies! Flora?
Flora: And he‚Äôs still clueless, thank the masks!
Keith: Uh, Trace? Who is this Flora?
Trace: Oh, I almost forgot to tell you. Flora is a‚Äî
Flora: Hiya, Trace!
Keith: It‚Äôs a Keidran! Trace, let me handle this!
Trace: Keith, stop!
Flora: Nya![TEMPLAR ACADEMY]
Academy Member 1: Amazing. I have never seen such power in someone so young.
Academy Member 2: Who is he?
Academy Member 1: Trace Legacy. He‚Äôs from a small town called Eversummer.
Academy Member 2: He‚Äôs strong. Almost as powerful as the Grand Templar herself.
Academy Member 1: What do you think, Grand Templar?
Mary: He is strong, there is no doubt. But he has no heart. He does as we say, he follows our orders. But I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve seen what he can really do.
Mary: If he were to have some real goal‚Ä¶
Mary: ‚Ä¶something or someone to really care about‚Ä¶
Mary: Then we‚Äôll see real power.
Keith: What the hell?!
Keith: Stop‚Äî ah!
Flora: Oh, my‚ÄîTrace: Ow‚Ä¶ my head. What just happened?
Keith: Okay, next time you plan on exploding, try giving me a little warning.
Keith: What‚Äôs the deal? I was just trying to kill that mangy feline.
Trace: But why? She‚Äôs Flora! Isn‚Äôt she like you? A keidran?
Keith: We‚Äôre two different races! I‚Äôm a Basitin, she‚Äôs a Keidran! They are a race of animals. We should kill her now, while we have the chance.
Flora: Mew?
Keith: You don‚Äôt understand, since you‚Äôve lost your memories. But just look at her! She‚Äôs the pure essence of evil!
Flora: Butterfly!
Keith: Um‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ see, what‚Äôd I tell you? Pure‚Ä¶ evil.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Maren: Have you found Trace‚Äôs trail yet Karen?
Karen: Not yet! I almost wish I had a Keidran nose rather than ears.
Karen: Oh, hold on. I think I hear someone coming this way.
Karen: Murr?
Raine: Ack! Look out!
Karen: Ack! Look out!
Karen: !!
Karen: Ugh‚Ä¶
Karen: Anyone get the number of that airship?
Raine: S-sorry!
Raine: P-please don‚Äôt hurt me!
Karen: Hurt you? Why would I do that?
Raine: Oh, my‚Ä¶
Raine: Um, nevermind.
Karen: So, what‚Äôs your name?
Raine: Raine. I‚Äôm kinda lost.
Karen: Hey, come with us!Keith: Fine. I‚Äôll travel with her for now. But we go to my city first. Afterwards, do what you like. I won‚Äôt be with you, though.
Keith: But Trace‚Ä¶
Keith: Believe me, if you go with that Keidran, she will eventually kill you.
Trace: Um, Flora? What he said isn‚Äôt true, is it? Would you‚Äî?
Flora: No No no! Of course not! I‚Äôm different from other Keidran! I wouldn‚Äôt kill anyone!
Trace: Well, I guess I‚Äôll take your word. Oh, by the way, I got you something.
Flora: Something‚Ä¶
Flora: for me?
Trace: Here! It‚Äôs a‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ what was it called?
Flora: Meeeaarr!!!
Flora: (thoughts) Is he really giving THAT to me?!
Flora: !!
Trace: (thoughts) Ah, crap. I‚Äôve done something stupid again, haven‚Äôt I?Trace: Er, sorry if I did something wrong. You don‚Äôt have to take it if you don‚Äôt want‚Äî
Flora: Wait!
Flora: I DO want it!Trace: Jeez! That‚Äôs some strong static electricity.
Flora: What have I done?! I knew that the subtleseed crystals were used in human marriages to bind two people together‚Ä¶ But I didn‚Äôt know that there was any magic in the crystal that actually DID something! Just how strongly are we bound together?
Flora: Sigh‚Ä¶
Flora: Well, I think it only works if I‚Äôm wearing it. I‚Äôll just take it off later.
Narration: That night‚Ä¶
Trace: Thanks for the food, Keith.
Keith: No problem. I‚Äôm pretty good at hunting.
Trace: Hey, Flora. We‚Äôre going to have a lot of time on our hands. I was wondering if you could try and teach me some of your language?
Flora: Well, sure. Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ grass is ch‚Äôrall.
Trace: Chall?
Flora: Heehee! Try again. It‚Äôs ch‚Äôrall.
Trace: Ch‚Äôrall?
Flora: Yeah. And trees are marlch‚Äôren.
Trace: What?!
Flora: Hahaha!
Sythe: Grrrr‚Ä¶Flora: Ah! T‚Äôanks for ‚Äòta drinks, Tracy‚Ä¶ Isn‚Äôt camphing out here fun? We shoul‚Äô do it more often, huh?
Trace: Uh, Flora, are you alright?
Keith: What did you put in that drink
Trace: Just ale, I think‚Ä¶
Keith: Hah!
Keith: Hah! You mean human ale. Keidran can‚Äôt handle much of that stuff.
Flora: Hah, I just notif‚Äôd how funny you humans look without fur on!
Keith: She gets quite honest when she‚Äôs had a few, doesn‚Äôt she? Let me try something. Hey Flora, how do you really feel about Trace and I?
Flora: Huh, Trace? I likes him. He‚Äôs nice to me, not like other humans. I know humans an‚Äô Keidran aren‚Äôt ‚Äîhic‚Äî s‚Äôpose to get along, bu‚Äô I can‚Äôt help it. ‚Ä¶oh, an‚Äô you? Umm‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre kinda a jerk.
Trace: Er, thanks, Flora.
Flora: You‚Äôre welcome!
Trace: Maybe I should help you to bed now.
Flora: Okay!
Flora: How‚Äôs ‚Äòbout you come to bed wits me?
Trace: I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea.
Keith: (thoughts) Hmph, that wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting. Either she‚Äôs a good actress, or as impossible as it seems, this Keidran truly does have feelings for a human. Interesting‚Ä¶Trace: Phew! We finally made it out of that forest. I thought it would never end! It‚Äôs good to be back out in the open air, right Flora?
Trace: Er, Flora? What is it?
Trace: Flora?
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Trace: What‚Äôs wrong?
Flora: Trace, I can‚Äôt take it anymore!
Trace: Take what? What‚Äôs bothering you?
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶
Flora: Please. Take me!Trace: Flora, what are you doing? We can‚Äôt‚Ä¶!
Flora: Why? You don‚Äôt like me?
Trace: No, it‚Äôs not that! I do, but we‚Äî
Flora: Good!
Trace: Ack!
Flora: So tell me, Trace. Does it bother you that I‚Äôm a Keidran?
Trace: Well, I guess it did at first. I had no idea what you were when we met, but‚Ä¶
Trace: I‚Äôve really grown attached to you. You‚Äôre the first person I met since I lost my memories. You‚Äôre the only person I‚Äôve found I can trust.
Flora: I‚Äôm glad to hear you say that, Trace.
Flora: Then‚Ä¶
Flora: My mission is complete!
Trace: Fl-Flora? Wh‚Äî?
Flora: I‚Äôm sorry. I really am.
Flora: But you forgot‚Ä¶
Flora: ‚Ä¶the first rule of the Templar‚Ä¶
Flora: Never.. trust‚Ä¶ a Keidran‚Ä¶
Trace: Aaaaah!Flora: Merr?
Flora: Ow, my head‚Ä¶ Who‚Äôs yelling?
Flora: Wha.. how did I get in a tent? I don‚Äôt remember anything from last night. Oh, that noise‚Ä¶ Trace is screaming in his sleep again.
Flora: ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm worried about him‚Ä¶
Sythe: Psst! Flora!
Flora: What? Sythe? Why are you here?
Flora: Don‚Äôt you know there‚Äôs a Basitin nearby?
Sythe: Flora, I need to speak with you alone. Come with me.
Flora: Uh, okay‚Ä¶
Flora: ‚Ä¶..
Flora: Alright, this is far enough. What is it?
Sythe: Flora, we must kill Trace, now!
Flora: What?!
Flora: Why?!Sythe: Why? He‚Äôs an evil human. Should there be any other reason?
Flora: He‚Äôs not evil! He has no memory. Why can‚Äôt we just capture him?
Flora: Why must we kill?
Sythe: You sound like you‚Äôre defending him!
Flora: No, I‚Äôm not! I know. We are Keidran and he is human. But why can‚Äôt we try?
Sythe: Flora, you traveling around with a human is a huge risk! Why are you going through this? He‚Äôs not just any Templar. He‚Äôs the Grand Templar.
Sythe: He‚Äôs murdered hundreds of our kind‚Ä¶ And you of all people should want him dead.
Flora: Why‚Äôs that?
Sythe: Because‚Ä¶
Sythe: Trace was the man who killed your family!Sythe: Flora, are you okay?
Flora: He killed them‚Ä¶?
Sythe: I‚Äôm sorry I had to bring up bad memories.
Sythe: But now you see why we need to kill him while he‚Äôs vulnerable. Let me take care of him‚Äî
Flora: No! I‚Ä¶ I have to do this. Give me the dagger.
Sythe: Please, don‚Äôt do anything foolish, Flora.
Flora: Don‚Äôt worry, I know what I‚Äôm doing.
Sythe: (thoughts) Phew‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gald that‚Äôs over with. I‚Äôm sorry I had to lie, Flora.
Sythe: (thoughts) How should I know if Trace was involved in your family‚Äôs death?
Sythe: (thoughts) But at least now that human will be out of the way.Flora: Why am I crying? Probably this stupid cry‚Äî huh?
Flora: ?
Keith: And where have you been, Keidran?
Flora: Er.. well, not that it‚Äôs any of your business, but I was just‚Ä¶ relieving myself, that‚Äôs all.
Flora: (thoughts) Better not let him see this‚Ä¶
Keith: I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôd bother going so far. You Keidran have no sense of modesty.
Keith: Which is a shame. A lack of modesty is wasted on such unattractive creatures. Just keep in mind that I‚Äôm watching you.
Flora: (thoughts) Patience, Flora. The Human first, then the jerk.Flora: The coast is clear. There‚Äôs Trace‚Äôs tent. And it‚Äôs even open. This‚Äôll make it easy.
Flora: I just wish I didn‚Äôt have to do this. I‚Äôve never had to‚Ä¶ kill a friend before‚Ä¶
Flora: No no no! Not a friend! I was just pretending! Why do I always forget that?
Flora: (thoughts) I just have to take this dagger‚Ä¶
Flora: (thoughts) And‚Ä¶ and then I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll just go and‚Ä¶
Flora: (thoughts) I‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt do it! I can‚Äôt go through with it! I know I swore revenge on the one who killed my family. But this is just wrong! Even if he did do it, he isn‚Äôt the same person! I just cannot kill someone who‚Äôs been so kind to me!
Flora: (thoughts) Trace‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre safe. From me, at least. Even if it goes against the laws, I want to be your friend.
Keith: I knew it!
Flora: Aah!Keith: I always knew you‚Äôd try to betray us! You filthy Keidran, I‚Äôll make sure you pay.
Flora: No‚Ä¶ Trace, h-help!
Trace: Hey! What‚Äôs going on?
Keith: Trace!
Flora: Trace!
Keith: Trace! I caught this Keidran getting ready to kill you! I told you she can‚Äôt be trusted!
Trace: That can‚Äôt be true! He‚Äôs lying, right, Flora?
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶ I ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Flora: I‚Äôm sorry!
Trace: Flora, wait!
Keith: Hah! At least we‚Äôre finally rid of that fleabag.Flora: Oh no‚Ä¶ I ran. Why did I run? Now he really will think I was going to kill him. I just panicked‚Ä¶
Flora: What am I going to do? Why do I feel so confused over some human?
Flora: I wonder what he‚Äôll do if he finds me?
Narration: Worst Case
Trace: Your betrayal has awakened my memories. Now you will die!
Narration: Best Case
Trace: Hey, Flora. I killed Keith. Let‚Äôs have sex.
Flora: Wha‚Äî?!
Flora: Why would I imagine that?! No, I must get away from‚Äî!
Flora: Aaah!
Flora: Oooph!
Flora: Ow‚Ä¶
Trace: Flora? Flora!!
Trace: Are you alright? Oh, no, your foot‚Ä¶
Flora: Please, just go away.
Trace: Why? Why are you running from me? Please, just tell me the truth!
Flora: Sigh‚Ä¶ yes, you should know the truth‚Ä¶
Flora: Keith was right. I was planning on betraying you tonight. I‚Ä¶ guess it was my plan all along. The truth is‚Ä¶ our two races are on the brink of war. Without your memories, I thought that I could take advantage of you. That is‚Ä¶ at first, anyway‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ but then I started to get to know you‚Ä¶
Flora: I can‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt want to anymore!
Flora: I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Flora: I don‚Äôt know what to do!
Flora: Ah?!
Trace: Flora, I believe you. I don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on, but I do know this‚Ä¶
Trace: You‚Äôre the first person I saw since I can remember.
Trace: I trust you, and I don‚Äôt want you to leave..
Flora: But I‚Ä¶ ah‚Ä¶ thank you.
Flora: But‚Ä¶ but what about Keith?
Trace: Oh, him? I took care of him. He won‚Äôt try that again.
Keith: I try to help a guy out, and what do I get?
Keith: Magically launched straight up a tree.
Keith: ‚Ä¶..

TomArt StudiosTrace: Alright, now‚Ä¶
Trace: Now does this hurt?
Flora: Ah! Cahrmehrs ab‚Äôliun nah!
Trace: I‚Äôll assume that means ‚Äúyes.‚Äù Well, your foot seems strained. You must have twisted it really bad when you fell. We need to see a healer about this.
Flora: But the only city with any clerics nearby is a human one.
Trace: Then we‚Äôll go there!
Flora: But Trace‚Ä¶!
Trace: Ah, come on, Flora. Don‚Äôt you trust me?
Trace: I trusted you!
Flora: Sigh‚Ä¶ Trace, you know I trust you‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs the other humans I don‚Äôt trust.
Trace: Don‚Äôt worry!
Trace: I won‚Äôt let anything happen to you. We‚Äôll be in and out of there in no time.Maren: So, Raine, what were you doing out here by yourself, anyway? Karen was saying you seemed to be in a hurry.
Raine: Me? Um, well, I was a slave to some.. uh.. Keidran. B-but‚Ä¶ then I escaped.
Karen: Oh, so that‚Äôs why you smell like a Keidran.
Raine: Er, yeah‚Ä¶
Raine: But isn‚Äôt she a Keidran‚Ä¶ or part Keidran‚Ä¶?
Maren: Karen? No, of course not.
Maren: Everyone knows it‚Äôs not possible for Keidran and Humans to crossbreed. She was cursed by Trace years ago. Karen seemed to like it though, and has had the ears ever since. But that‚Äôs history. We need to find out where Trace is now. He headed this way. There‚Äôs a city nearby where we can get supplies. Then we can continue.
Raine: A ‚Äî a city? No, no! I think I‚Äôll just be going now‚Äî
Karen: Oh, no you don‚Äôt! You‚Äôre coming with us! It‚Äôll be fun! Like an adventure.
Karen: To the city!
Raine: Nooooo!Flora: I can see the city across the trees.
Trace: What is that?
Flora: Oh, that? It‚Äôs a Templar Mana Battery. They call them ‚ÄúTowers.‚Äù It‚Äôs scary..
Flora: They started building them right around‚Ä¶ when you became Grand Templar.
Trace: When I became Grand Templar?
Flora: Huh‚Ä¶ Trace?
Narration: Four years ago.
Mary: Please, stop this, Trace!
Mary: You can‚Äôt do this to me.!I am the grand Templar!
Mary: If you kill me, they‚Äôll never let you become Grand Templar! You‚Äôre insane!
Trace: I think they‚Äôll have little choice in the matter. But you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm not going to kill you. There are far worse fates.
Mary: W-what are you‚Äî Aaah! What‚Ä¶ what are you doing to me, Trace?!
Mary: Urg‚Ä¶ this can‚Äôt be happening!Mary: Aaaah! Please, stop it! I‚Äôll do anything, just please‚Ä¶
Trace: Hurts like hell, doesn‚Äôt it? Now you know how I‚Äôve felt all these years.
Mary: Trace.. you bast‚Äî aaah!
Mary: Aaaaaahhh!
Trace: Heh, you look good as a wolf.
Trace: Won‚Äôt your daughter be surprised when she sees you now. I‚Äôll be sure she does.
Mary: No! Not Raine! She‚Äôs just a child! You monster!
Trace: You‚Äôre the monster now.
[WANTED: Posing as a shopkeeper 3000G]
Trace: This is only the beginning.
Flora: Trace?
Flora: Trace!
Flora: Trace?
Trace: Huh? Keidran?
Flora: It‚Äôs me, Flora!
Trace: Oh, Flora! Sorry, I must have been daydreaming. Heh heh. I must still be‚Ä¶
Trace: ‚ÄòCause it looks like you‚Äôre naked again.
Flora: Mrrrr..Flora: Remember, Trace. I don‚Äôt have to wear my clothes all the time.
Flora: Anyway, the easiest way to get me into the city is for you to pretend I‚Äôm your slave.
Trace: S-slave?! Flora, I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Flora: Here, tie me up. It‚Äôll be more convincing. It‚Äôll be okay‚Ä¶
Trace: Are you sure‚Ä¶?
Flora: Free Keidran are not allowed in this city. It‚Äôs the only way.
Trace: Alright‚Ä¶
Trace: I won‚Äôt let anyone hurt you, Flora. I promise.Karen: Oooh, look over there!
Maren: Karen, would you please calm down?
Karen: But look at all the neat stuff! Look! They‚Äôre selling Keidran! And clothes! Jewelry!
Maren: We‚Äôre just here to get supplies. Keep your ears down.
Karen: What‚Äôs the fun in that?
Maren: Settle down! And be on the look out for Trace. He might have come here too.
Karen: Okay, but can we at least stay at the bath house for a little while?
Maren: Oh, fine.
Trace: Oh, hey. There‚Äôs a cleric. He should be able to heal you. Excuse me, can you help us? She‚Äôs hurt.
Healer: What is this? Do I look like a vet? I don‚Äôt treat Keidran.
Healer: Who do you think you are?
Trace: I am Grand Templar Trace, and you will heal her.
Healer: Gah! G-grand Templar?Healer: There ya go, good as new!
Healer: I bet that Templar of yours is fixing you up for the Festival tomorrow. I‚Äôve been looking for a good Keidran slave, and I‚Äôve never seen one quite as beautiful as you. If I happen to buy you, I promise I won‚Äôt push you too hard. Your body is almost perfect for the job‚Ä¶
Healer: If only your breasts weren‚Äôt so small.
[¬Ω Price BROKEN]
Trace: There‚Äôs something about this city that really calms me. I wonder if I‚Äôve been here before? I wish I could remember‚Ä¶ anything. But then again, I‚Äôm not really sure if I want to know the kind of person I was.
Trace: I think I‚Äôll just enjoy the time I have with Flora for now and worry about it later. ‚Ä¶this place really is peaceful‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace, are my breasts too small?
[¬Ω PRICE BROKEN]
Trace: Wa-what? No, of course not, Flora.
Flora: But you wouldn‚Äôt know, you don‚Äôt have any memories!
Flora: Come on! I need to compare with someone!Karen: Isn‚Äôt this fun, Raine?
Raine: Y-yes, it‚Äôs nice. Thank you for letting me come along.
Karen: Of course!
Maren: But after this we need to leave and find Trace.
Raine: Oh, look.
Announcer: Please be advised, this Keidran is under Templar protection. Do not harass her if you value your life.
Karen: She doesn‚Äôt look too happy.
Maren: Well, duh. It‚Äôs probably going to be sold soon. Can you imagine what‚Äôs going through her mind?
Flora: (thoughts) Their breasts‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶are bigger than mine‚Ä¶Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: Mrr‚Ä¶?
Trace: Wonder what‚Äôs gotten into Flora lately? Well,a s long as I‚Äôm here, maybe I should take a bath as well.
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: Father, the Grand Templar‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs here. I can see him‚Ä¶
Master Seer: So Neutral failed? No matter. Thank you, dear, now get off to bed.
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: But Father, will he try and hurt you?
Master Seer: Do not worry yourself. Daddy will handle everything. Now get some rest.
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: As you wish, Father.
Master Seer: (thoughts) So, Master, have you come to reclaim your title?Trace: Man, finally I get to relax. Flora‚Äôs been acting odd ever since we got here. I wonder what‚Äôs wrong?
Trace: Oh, well. Time for some peace and quiet.
Red: TRACE!!
Red: Trace, I don‚Äôt believe it! We‚Äôve been looking all over for you!
Trace: Oh, it‚Äôs you‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs your name again?
Red: No time! Come on! We know about your memory loss. We‚Äôll have you back to your Keidran-hating self in no time!
Red: Girls! Guess what? I found Trace‚Äî!
Red: Er‚Ä¶ right‚Ä¶ ladies baths‚Ä¶
Raine: Aaah!
Karen: Hi, guys!
Maren: Hmph‚Ä¶
Flora: Mrrr?Red: Demon Woman.
[Girls‚Äô Baths ‚á®]
Maren: Trace!
Maren: Please, join us. I‚Äôm so glad we finally found you! Sorry about the first time we met. I had no ideas you had your memories erased. But that‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶
Karen: I‚Äôm sure we could help you remember.
Flora: Well, I‚Äôm done with my bath! Come on, Trace!
Trace: Er, but‚Ä¶ oh, okay‚Ä¶
Maren: Did that Keidran‚Ä¶ just give orders to Trace? She‚Äôs trying to brainwash him!
Karen: After them!
Maren: Hey, put some clothes on first!Trace: Flora! Why are we running?
Flora: I don‚Äôt trust those guys!
Trace: But they knew about my past!
Flora: Exactly!
Trace: Eh? A storm?
Flora: Trace, there‚Äôs a tavern! We can stay there for now.
Maren: Oh, just perfect! Of course it starts to rain.
Maren: There‚Äôs a tavern. We can get out of the rain. They won‚Äôt be getting far in this storm.
Keith: (thoughts) Trace, where are you? Well, I‚Äôm not going to find them in this weather. I might as well stay at that tavern for now.Sirus (Tavernkeeper): Ah, greetings, Grand Templar! Welcome to my humble tavern! What may I get you?
Trace: Um, we just need a room.
Sirus (Tavernkeeper): Certainly. I have a suite prepared for you.
Sirus (Tavernkeeper): And a nice, strong steel cage in the basement for your Keidran. We guarantee she won‚Äôt be able to escape, and we‚Äôve taken out the liberty of clearing out the rats about three months ago.
Trace: What?! I don‚Äôt want her alone in a cage!
Sirus (Tavernkeeper): Huh? Alone? Oh, I get it.
Sirus (Tavernkeeper): So she‚Äôs a breeder, eh?
Sirus (Tavernkeeper): In that case, we have plenty of virile male Keidrans. One night and you can expect her to have kittens in no time!
Flora: Nyaaaaa!
Trace: No! NO!
Trace: I‚Äî I think I‚Äôll just have her stay in my room for tonight!
Sirus (Tavernkeeper): (thoughts) Ooooh, this will be interesting.Trace: This is our room.
Flora: Ah! It‚Äôs wonderful!
Trace: Well, better than sleeping in the woods, I suppose‚Ä¶
Flora: Ah! A bed, finally!
Flora: Ah!
Flora: I‚Äôm so happy! Mrrr, a bed! I haven‚Äôt slept in one in so long!
Trace: Yeah, but‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs only one bed.
Flora: Ah?
Flora: Oh‚Ä¶ So there is. Well, the floor‚Äôs fine too. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ used to it. It‚Äôs your room, after all.
Flora: No big deal, I‚Äôll just lay dow‚Äî
Flora: Meeer?
Trace: Come on, Kitty. Back on the bed. I‚Äôll sleep on the floor.Flora: Oh, Trace. I‚Äôve been meaning to apologize for the way I‚Äôve been acting today. It was silly of me.
Trace: Don‚Äôt worry about it, Flora! It‚Äôs normal for someone your age.
Flora: But that‚Äôs the point! It‚Äôs not normal! ‚Ä¶at least, not for a Keidran.
Flora: Truth is, I haven‚Äôt really been acting much like a Keidran.
Flora: Actually, I‚Äôve been trying to act as much like a human as possible‚Ä¶ Ever since we got to know each other, anyway.
Trace: But why would you try and act like a human? You‚Äôre a Keidran. It doesn‚Äôt really matter, does it?
Flora: Humans.. they have so many prejudices against us and how we behave. I‚Äôm afraid that if you saw me acting like a normal Keidran, you would think of me as‚Ä¶ well.. as an animal. I just don‚Äôt want you to think of me that way.
Trace: Flora! You know I‚Äôd‚Äî
Trace: Yes?
Sirus (Tavernkeeper): Grand Templar? I hope I‚Äôm not interrupting. I have some‚Ä¶ refreshments or you and your Keidran.Sirus (Tavernkeeper): Greetings, Grand Templar.
Sirus (Tavernkeeper): I have your favorite ale‚Ä¶
Sirus (Tavernkeeper): And for your Keidran, a special milk that‚Äôs sure to make her‚Ä¶ happy.
Trace: Uh, thanks, I guess.
Trace: Hey, Flora. The inn keeper got you this drink. But I‚Äôm not sure if you should take it. I don‚Äôt really trust that guy.
Flora: Let me see it‚Ä¶ Hey, I remember this drink from when I was a kitten. My mom used to drink this. At least, before she had my sister. But she would never let me have any. She said I wasn‚Äôt ready yet.
Trace: Well, you probably shouldn‚Äôt drink it then. I‚Äôll go down and ask for something else‚Äî
Trace: Geh, Flora!
Flora: Murph‚Ä¶ murph‚Ä¶!Trace: Flora! Are you‚Ä¶ okay?
Flora: Mraaah!
Flora: I feel fine. I guess this drink really isn‚Äôt a big deal.
Trace: Oh, thank goodness, for a second I thought it was poison.
Trace: Uh, Flora? Your chest‚Ä¶
Flora: Hm?
Flora: Oh, it‚Äôs the necklace you gave me. I tucked it into my fur when we first entered the city. It tends to glow sometimes.
Trace: Hmmm‚Ä¶ Lemme see‚Ä¶
Flora: !!
Flora: Meeerr?
Trace: Maybe it‚Äôs like a mood ring? Are you feeling any strange moods at the moment?Trace: I guess it‚Äôs just a‚Äî
Trace: Ah! W-why did you do that, Flora?
Trace: Flora, w-what‚Äôs the matter with you? Cut it out!
Trace: What are you doing?!
Trace: Aaaah! No! Stop! Anywhere but there!
Maren: Huh? Was that Trace‚Äôs‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶voice coming from‚Ä¶
Sythe: ‚Ä¶that room over there?Trace: Flora, please! Think about what you‚Äôre doing! Something was in that milk! Hey, I need  those pants.
Flora: Merrheha!
Trace: eep!
Trace: Gaaah! Flora, you‚Äôre mmmph sphmph!
Flora: Mraaaah!
Flora: Mrr‚Äî ah? Trace?
Flora: Yawn!
Flora: Mrrr‚Ä¶
Trace: Huh? She‚Ä¶ fell asleep? Thank goodness. I guess she drank too much of that stuff. Arg, now I‚Äôm stuck. How do I get up without waking her? I guess it‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt hurt if I stayed like this.
Group Member: Hey, I think I heard him in this room!Red: Alright, I think we‚Äôre in!
Maren: You idiot! Could you not destroy everything?
Keith: You guys do know the door‚Äôs unlocked, right?
Sythe: What have you done with my Flora?
Tom: Tom‚Äôs Pizza Delivery. I‚Äôve got a large with extra anch‚Äî Oh my god!Karen: Woohoo Trace!
Trace: Erm‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not what it looks like?Sythe: What have you done?! I‚Äôll kill you for this, Trace!
Maren: Oh no you don‚Äôt! Not before I kill him first!
Sythe: Yip!
Keith: Erg, that Keidran is getting in the way of my mission again! I‚Äôll take care of her once and for all!
Karen: Hey, don‚Äôt hurt the poor widdle Keidran!
Keith: Uhm?!
Tom: Um‚Ä¶ Maybe I should come back another time‚Ä¶
Red: In the name of meaningless battle!
Tom: eep!Raine: W-what‚Äôs going on? I thought you were looking for the Templar?
Maren: Huh? Ack, where did he go?
Karen: Wee!
Sythe: Help‚Ä¶ me‚Ä¶!
Red: And stay down!
Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Trace: Um, could I get another room? Mine‚Ä¶ seems to have a few holes in it.
Maren: So‚Ä¶
Maren: ‚Ä¶now what do we do?
Group Member: Mmm‚Ä¶ pizza!
Maren: You know, once we finish this, we‚Äôll have to be enemies again.
Sythe: Of course, but it wouldn‚Äôt hurt if we‚Ä¶ took our time.
Keith: (thoughts) Hm, what‚Äôs this? Must be a special human drink.
Keith: (thoughts) Well, I guess I‚Äôll have some.Narration: That night‚Ä¶
Flora: Oh, Keith. Does it really matter that I am a Keidran?
Keith: No, not wh-when you‚Äôre doing this.
Flora: I‚Äôm glad‚Ä¶
Keith: Huh?
Keith: Ugh, what a nightmare. Why in the world would I think up something like that‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶Huh?
Keith: Ah, great, I‚Äôm gunna need a cold shower.Flora: Mrrr‚Ä¶ Meerrr?
Flora: Oh, it‚Äôs morning already!
Flora: Wow, I feel amazing! I‚Äôd forgotten how wonderful beds are!
Flora: Trace? Awww! Trace must have been really tired. He‚Äôs still asleep!
Flora: Well, I can‚Äôt go outside in this city. I guess I‚Äôll just nap ‚Äòtill he gets up.
Flora: (thoughts) I probably shouldn‚Äôt be doing this, but I‚Äôm sure he won‚Äôt mind.
Flora: (thoughts) I don‚Äôt know why, but for some reason, I feel really.. glad. I think‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôll stay with Trace just a little while longer.

Flora: Wait.. ‚Ä¶for me!
Flora: Mrrhm? Are they the people Kei was talking about?
Flora: (thoughts) I wonder which is the Grand Templar?
Euchre: Flora! Look out!
Flora: Nah?
Euchre: Move out of the way!
Flora: Ah!
Euchre: Arg, gotcha!
Flora: Mra?!
Flora: Euchre, you saved me!
Euchre: Of course, Miss Flora. I could never allow anything to bring you to harm.
Flora: Thank you!Euchre: Well, now that the humans are distracted, tell me, Flora‚Ä¶ How have you been doing lately? Have your masters been treating you alright?
Flora: Um, yes, I think they have‚Ä¶. They‚Äôre all very nice to me. And Kei always lets me play with him.
Euchre: Is that so? You are truly blessed to have such kind human masters.
Flora: You think so?
Euchre: I do‚Ä¶ say, what‚Äôs that around your neck?
Flora: Oh, this? It was a present from Kei‚Äôs father‚Ä¶
Euchre: A collar, huh?
Euchre: Well, I‚Äôd better be going before my masters notice I‚Äôm missing. Take care, Miss Flora. And remember.
Euchre: I‚Äôll always be here for you if you ever need my help. I promise you.Trace: Ah, it‚Äôs morning! It feels good to not wake up to a nightmare for once!
Trace: I wonder why I didn‚Äôt have‚Äî urk!
Trace: (thoughts) Flora‚Ä¶ lying on top of me‚Ä¶ So soft‚Ä¶ So warm‚Ä¶
Trace: Aaaack! What is she doing in my bed!? What have we done?
Flora: Meeerr?
Flora: ?
Flora: Trace, what‚Äôs wrong? Are we under attack? Did something happen?
Trace: In bed‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶. we didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ we couldn‚Äôt have‚Ä¶
Flora: Yeah, we did! It was really nice!
Trace: What!? You mean we‚Ä¶?!
Flora: Yup!Trace: Oh man‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt ever scare me like that again! I think I‚Äôm gunna have a heart attack!
Flora: Why? All I said was that I enjoyed spending the night in the same bed. What did you think I was talking about?
Trace: Err‚Ä¶ nevermind.
Trace: Heh, for someone who acts like you do, it‚Äôs surprising you don‚Äôt know what I mean.
Flora: Hey! What do you mean by that?
Flora: I‚Äôm a Keidran. All Keidran my age act like this.
Trace: Well, that‚Äôs not what I meant‚Ä¶ But now that I think about it, how old are you anyway?
Flora: Oh, I‚Äôm not really sure. I think I‚Äôm probably eleven by now.
Trace: ‚Ä¶
Trace: You‚Äôre eleven years old?!Judge: Trace Legacy. You have been found guilty of molesting this innocent 11-year old.
Trace: B-but I‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶!
Judge: Your sentence is death.
Trace: What? But.. I didn‚Äôt know! Wait!! Hold on! I didn‚Äôt do it!
Flora: Trace!
Flora: Trace!!
Trace: You gotta believe me!
Flora: Trace! Snap out of it!
Trace: Gah!
Flora: Oh no! Trace! I‚Äôm so sorry!
Flora: I forgot about my claws!
Narration: A few stitches later‚Ä¶
Trace: So Keidran don‚Äôt live as long as humans?
Flora: Right, in Keidran years, I‚Äôm an adult. Honest!
Trace: So how long do Keidran live?
Flora: Well‚Ä¶
Flora: Er‚Ä¶ no time for that right now! We need to get packed and out of this human city!
Trace: Heh. You‚Äôre going to be the death of me, Flora.Trace: I‚Äôll be back in a bit, Flora. Just need to get some bags to put our stuff in.
Flora: Alright, Trace.
Trace: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶And to get a cleric to look at this. Man, sometimes that Flora does act like an animal. ‚Ä¶ Wait, I shouldn‚Äôt be thinking about Flora like that. She‚Äôs not.
Trace: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶ Or is she?
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Keith: Oh, Trace. I was hoping I‚Äôd‚Äî  Whoa, what happened to you?
Trace: What do you mean?
Keith: Eh‚Ä¶
Trace: She didn‚Äôt do it on purpose. She just gets a little over-enthusiastic now and then.
Keith: Yes, I‚Äôve heard female Keidran can get that way.
Keith: (thoughts) Somehow, I‚Äôve got to convince him to let me travel along again. I still need him for my mission.
Keith: (thoughts) And without him it might be a little harder to get out of this human town with my fur intact.Trace: I‚Äôm back!
Flora: Oh, hey, Trace! What do you think? I finally got a chance to brush my fur after being in those woods.
Trace: Wow, you look great, Flora!
Flora: Aww, thank you!
Trace: Hey, Flora.
Trace: I just talked with Keith. He says he wants to travel with us again. Should we let him?
Flora: Keith? The Basitin? B-but I was hoping we‚Äôd be traveling.. um.. just the two of us.
Flora: Plus, he‚Äôs mean!
Trace: Well, I was just thinking‚Ä¶ If we traveled with him to his people, then‚Ä¶ We would‚Ä¶ heh‚Ä¶ have more time to be‚Ä¶ together. If we went straight to Keidran territory, we‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt.
Flora: Nya!
Flora: Well then, let‚Äôs get packing! Don‚Äôt want to keep Keith waiting too long!
Trace: Eheh‚Ä¶
Trace: I think it was then that I realized‚Ä¶
Trace: I didn‚Äôt really intend on ever leaving her.Flora: Aw, why do I have to wear this?
Trace: Because I feel more comfortable when you‚Äôre at least wearing something. Besides, with that symbol, people know you‚Äôre with me. Plus, I think you look cute with it on.
Flora: Really?
Trace: (thoughts) Or at least less like an animal.
Flora: !
Trace: Well, Keith said to meet him in an hour, so‚Ä¶ What do you want to do?
Flora: Uh‚Ä¶. Trace?
Trace: Hm?
Flora: I‚Äôm hungry‚Ä¶
Trace: Eek! Um, okay, what do you want to eat?
Flora: Oh, anything! I‚Äôm starving! Just look at me!
Trace: Oh, wait‚Ä¶ I think‚Ä¶ yeah, here you go.
Trace: I got some bread from the tavern. You can have it, I‚Äôve already had one.
Flora: Uh‚Ä¶ bread?
Trace: Yeah. What‚Äôs the matter?
Flora: Um, Trace. I think I need to explain to you more about Keidran.Trace: So, you‚Äôre a carnivore?
Flora: Well, I guess so. We only eat meat. When I was a slave, I got really sick once when they fed me some bread.
Trace: I guess that‚Äôs out, then‚Ä¶
Flora: Oh, but I know what I‚Äôd really like‚Ä¶.
Flora: Human flesh!
Trace: Aaah!
Trace: W-well‚Ä¶ I-I‚Äôm going to go‚Ä¶ see what I can find.
Flora: Eh?
Flora: I was just‚Ä¶ kidding‚Ä¶ Oh, shoot. I did it again. I let my Keidran get the best of me.
Flora: Now Trace is scared of me again. Why can‚Äôt I just act normal?
Euchre: Now, Miss Flora, what have I told you? You should just act like yourself.Flora: Euchre?!
Euchre: Greetings, Flora. It‚Äôs been quite a while, hasn‚Äôt it? Amazing, of all the places, we meet up here.
Euchre: So, how have you been doing since the escape?
Euchre: Flora? What‚Äôs wrong?
Flora: It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ been so long‚Ä¶ E-Euchre‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve missed you so much! But why are you in that cage?
Euchre: Oh, this? Funny story, actually‚Ä¶ I was out for a morning walk the other day.
Euchre: And these generous humans offered me a lift. I politely refused‚Ä¶
Euchre: But they were very insistent.Flora: B-but Euchre! This is horrible! I can‚Äôt stand to see in you chains again! I have to get you out of here!
Euchre: Splendid idea!
Euchre: I was just thinking about leaving, myself!
Euchre: I have to say, of all the people I‚Äôve met, you‚Äôre the one I‚Äôve always hoped to see again. I‚Äôd be honored to travel with you.
Euchre: There is one problem, though. You see, I‚Äôve already been sold, and apparently it‚Äôs to someone of royalty.
Euchre: So even if you were a human, you still wouldn‚Äôt be able to buy me.
Euchre: I‚Äôd imagine the only one capable of getting me out now would be the Grand Templar himself!
Flora: ‚Ä¶Trace: So you need my help to gain support from the rest of the humans?
Keith: Yes, basically.
Keith: But there‚Äôs more. You need to know th‚Äî
Flora: Trace!
Trace: Eh? Flora?
Keith: Stupid Keidran.
Trace: Flora? What‚Äôs wrong? Did something happen to you?
Flora: Huff‚Ä¶ no, no! Huff. I just saw a friend of mine‚Äî another Keidran! I need your help! You‚Äôre the only one who can get him out!
Keith: Wait, Trace!
Keith: Can I talk to you in private?
Keith: Trace, this is a really bad idea! One Keidran is bad enough, but two?
Keith: There is no way I‚Äôm going to travel around with two Keidran!
Keith: Besides, if it‚Äôs a male, then you know you‚Äôll never get any sleep at night with the noise they‚Äôll be making.Trace: What are you talking about? Flora would never‚Äî
Keith: Oh, you and your Keidran! How long have you known Flora, exactly? A week, maybe. Trust me, Keidran are more like animals than you think. They treat indecent activities as normal!
Keith: If you get two together, they won‚Äôt be able to control themselves. You won‚Äôt like what happens.
Keith: Now put your foot down and tell her.
Trace: Okay! Okay!
Trace: Flora, I‚Äôm sorry, but‚Ä¶
Trace: ‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶
Trace: ‚Ä¶you need to eat something before we set your friend free!Raine: Guys?
Raine: Hey, still asleep? I thought you‚Äôd want to be up by now to catch that Templar.

Maren: Oh, no! What time is it?
Maren: Everyone wake up! We overslept!
Maren: Hurry up! Hurry up! Hey, aren‚Äôt you forgetting something there, ‚Äî
Red: Nope! Got my sword right here!
Maren: Mindless dolt.
Maren: Karen? What are you doing hanging on the balcony?
Karen: Just having fun!
Maren: Oh, whatever. Did you see where Trace went?
Karen: Yeah, he walked out and went left down the road.
Maren: Thanks. Guys! Head out to your left!
Karen: (thoughts) Oh, wait, which way is left again?Keith: So who is this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of yours, exactly?
Flora: Well, his name is Euchre, and I‚Äôve known him since I was a kitten. He always seemed very cheerful, even as a slave.
Flora: He helped me out, even-e-even when m-my masters locked me up and sold me.
Flora: He was always there, even when my human friends betrayed me. He helped me escape, and I learned never to trust another human again!
Flora: ‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Trace: ‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace!
Trace: Aguah?!Flora: (in Keidran) Euchre! I‚Äôm back! I brought some friends!
Euchre: (in Keidran) Oh, good! I knew I could count on you, Flora!
Euchre: (in Keidran) So, this is the Templar, huh?
Trace: (thoughts) Geez, that‚Äôs one big Keidran.
Euchre: (in Keidran) He‚Äôs your‚Ä¶ new master, eh?
Flora: (in Keidran) No, not master! Er, I‚Äôll explain later.
Flora: Trace, could you‚Ä¶?
Trace: Yeah, sure. I‚Äôll go talk to that guy up there and see what I can do.
Flora: Thanks, Trace.
Trace: Of course!
Euchre: (in Keidran) Hm, a Basitin, too? You‚Äôre hanging around with an interesting crowd nowadays, Flora.
Keith: What are you looking at, Keidran?
Trace: Excuse me, Sir. I‚Äôd like to‚Äî
Bounty Hunter: I‚Äôve been expecting you, Trace.
Trace: What?
Bounty Hunter: The Templar Masters have a bounty on you that I intend to collect.
[5000000]Euchre: Thank you again, Flora. I am forever in your debt for this.
Flora: Aww, I didn‚Äôt really do anythin‚Äî
Flora: Huh, what was that feeling?
Euchre: Interesting‚Ä¶
Trace: Aaaaagh!
Bounty Hunter: Hah! They told me your powers were crippled, but this is too easy! You‚Äôre even weaker than a Templar‚Äôs apprentice!
Bounty Hunter: Now I know why they wanted to get rid of you!
Flora: Hey! Leave him alone!
Bounty Hunter: Aw, isn‚Äôt that cute? A loyal slave.
Bounty Hunter: Stay out of this, Keidran!
Trace: Flora!Tom: Hey all! Tom here, creator, writer, and former pizza-guy of the comic!
Tom: Yeah, yeah, it‚Äôs another filler. But there‚Äôs a good reason this time!
Tom: Today, I turn seventeen! Yup, I‚Äôm an old guy.
Tom: So I guess I decided to give myself some time off.
Tom: ‚Ä¶don‚Äôt kill me‚Ä¶
Flora: Outta my way! I‚Äôm in the middle of something!
Tom: Hey!Trace: No, Flora! I have to do something
Trace: Ah! What‚Ä¶ what is this? What are these images?
Trace: Dreams? No, not dreams‚Ä¶ Memories?
Trace: They can‚Ä¶ they can‚Äôt do this to me. No! They‚Ä¶ No one controls me!
Trace: I won‚Äôt be controlled!
Templar: Master Templar..? I‚Äôm sensing an energy fluctuation. Someone is trying to access the tower‚Äôs energies.Templar: What.. what‚Äôs going on? I can‚Äôt stop it! How..? Who could be this powerful? No! He‚Äôs using too much energy! The Tower Sphere can‚Äôt handle this kind of change!
Templar: I this keeps up the tower may collapse!
Trace: Arg! Get out of my head! Leave me alone!! I can‚Äôt remember! What is this? What does it mean?
Trace: Who am I?!?
Bounty Hunter: What!? How did you break thru my barrier?
Bounty Hunter: You haven‚Äôt won yet, Trace!

Bounty Hunter: You‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre powerless! They told me you were! You can‚Äôt do this!Trace: Leave her alone‚Ä¶

Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Templar 1: ‚ÄúBecome a templar‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs completely safe‚Äù they said!
Templar 2: (thoughts) Does my insurance cover tower collapses?
Flora: Grrrr‚Ä¶
Trace: You‚Ä¶
Trace: What‚Ä¶ the‚Ä¶?
Flora: !
Trace: !Trace: You.. you Kei‚Ä¶ uh..
Trace: Ah, my head. What happened? Where am I? And why do I have this really horrific looking gash in my left arm?
Flora: Grrrrr‚Ä¶
Trace: Huh? What is that‚Ä¶
Trace: Ah! Flora? What happened? What‚Äôs going on?
Euchre: I think I can answer that.
Trace: !
Euchre: But we don‚Äôt have time!
Trace: Gah!
Flora: Euchre! You‚Äôre alive! But I thought‚Ä¶ I saw you get hit by the fireball!
Euchre: Oh, I‚Äôm tougher than I look.
Euchre: But I‚Äôm not important right now. Are you okay?
Flora: I guess so‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶ he‚Ä¶ he attacked me‚Ä¶
Flora: Why would he do something like that?
Euchre: Flora, you‚Äôre going to have to trust me when I tell you, Trace wasn‚Äôt in control of himself. Someone was using the Tower to make Trace go berserk and act out his old emotions.
Flora: How do you know this?
Euchre: Well‚Ä¶ just trust me for now, Flora.
Flora: Why would they want him to remember?
Euchre: Trace was very important to the Templars, even if some of them might want him out of the way‚Ä¶ But there‚Äôs someone I know who I suspect is behind this‚Ä¶ Someone who cares nothing for the fate of neither Human nor Keidran.
Master Seer: Ephemural!
Master Seer: Look what you‚Äôve done! You‚Äôve destroyed everything!
Mary (Ephemural): Oh? You don‚Äôt like my plan?
Master Seer: Plan? You‚Äôve destroyed my Tower and nearly killed everyone but Trace! Your plan is a failure.
Mary (Ephemural): Wrong! I do not involve myself with the petty quarrels of you Templar mortals. I care not for Trace‚Äôs fate!
Ephemural: There is only one I thing I seek: balance! I am Neutrality.
Ephemural: I‚Äôm after‚Ä¶ her.
Master Seer: Her? But she‚Äôs just an ordinary Keidran‚Ä¶
Ephemural: I have foreseen that she will one day bring balance to the races of this world.
Ephemural: And betrayal is the key to spark the hatred to make it happen.Flora: He still has a fever. I don‚Äôt know what to do.
Euchre: Flora, relax. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be fine‚Ä¶ Tell me, why do you feel you need to help this human?
Flora: ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know.
Flora: You know I‚Äôve always felt that humans weren‚Äôt all that bad.
Euchre: Mmhm. ‚Ä¶You sure have fallen for this guy, haven‚Äôt you?
Flora: What?! No! I‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt even thought‚Ä¶ well.. we‚Äôre just friends!
Euchre: Hmm‚Ä¶
Euchre: I seem to remember you being ‚Äújust friends‚Äù with a human once before. And you know how that turned out, don‚Äôt you?
Flora: Yeah, yeah..
Flora: But I was young and stupid back then. I won‚Äôt make the same mistake again‚Ä¶
Euchre: Heh, so you‚Äôre saying you aren‚Äôt young anymore?
Flora: Oh, hush‚Ä¶
Euchre: Flora, listen to me. You know you‚Äôre like a sister to me.
Euchre: But I‚Äôm getting old. I‚Äôm twenty-one. If I‚Äôm lucky, I may live to see another few years, but I can‚Äôt protect you forever.Euchre: Ah, look at you, your fur is in knots!
Flora: Euchre, I‚Äôm fine‚Äî
Euchre: I know, I know.
Euchre: Look, why don‚Äôt you go and take a bath in that river we found and then get off to bed.
Flora: Oh, okay.
Euchre: I‚Äôll be in my tent if you need me.
Keith: Keidran‚Ä¶
Keith: My plans were almost ruined yesterday. Just about lost my ticket home.
Keith: And Flora risked her life to try and snap Trace out of it. Eh, I shouldn‚Äôt even care if she died or not.
Keith: So why do I feel so guilty about not helping her!?
Keith: This is insane. I am a basitin warrior!
Keith: And she‚Äôs getting in the way of my plans. What I really need is to get rid of her.
Keith: But I gave Trace my word I wouldn‚Äôt even touch her.
Keith: ‚Ä¶ Then again, all‚Äôs fair, as the saying goes.Keith: Eh.. Uhm..?
Keith: Wha‚Äî What? Where am I?
Keith: No‚Ä¶ it can‚Äôt be! I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ back home?
Keith: This.. isn‚Äôt possible. This is my island!
Keith: It‚Äôs just like I remember!
Vehra: Keith!
Keith: Huh? Vehra?
Vehra: Of course, kiddo! What are you doing out here?
Vehra: Sleeping on the beach again?
Vehra: Well, gotta go.
Vehra: See ya around, Keith Keiser.
Keith: Wait! Vehra!
Keith: Don‚Äôt leave! Y‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre alive‚Ä¶.
Cornelius: Keith!
Keith: Uh..?
Keith: Dad..?
Cornelius: What are you doing out here? You lazy, pathetic excuse for a Keiser!Keith: No, please‚Ä¶
Keith: Not again.. don‚Äôt make me see this again..
Judge: Keith Keiser. For your actions against the basitin people; for the murder of your own two parents;
Judge: For bringing shame not only on yourself but on your family name:

TomArt StudiosFlora: Gasp!
Flora: C-c-cold! This water is freezing!
Flora: Darn Euchre‚Ä¶
Flora: He could have at least offered to help. It‚Äôll take forever to get all this dirt out of my fur.
Flora: I wish Trace were here. I bet he wouldn‚Äôt mind‚Ä¶ maybe‚Ä¶
Flora: Huh? Euchre? Is that you?
Trace: Uh, hi, Flora.
Flora: Ah! Trace! I‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ erm‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt come in here! I‚Äôm naked!
Flora: Oh, wait‚Ä¶.Flora: Trace, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre‚Ä¶ okay. I was‚Ä¶ afraid you might bleed to death from when I clawed your arm.
Trace: Yeah, it still hurts, but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not too bad now.
Trace: Flora, I‚Ä¶
Flora: !!
Flora: Nyaaah‚Ä¶
Trace: Wait, Flora!
Trace: (thoughts) After all the time we‚Äôve been together‚Ä¶
Trace: (thoughts) Are we back to where we started? How could I ruin it all in one day?
Trace: Flora, I‚Äôm really sorry.Trace: (thoughts) Well, I guess that‚Äôs it then. Flora will probably want to go back to her home with that Euchre guy. Of course she would. What could she want from me? We‚Äôre just too different.
Trace: Well‚Ä¶ Goodbye, Flora.
Flora: Neh? No‚Ä¶ wa‚Ä¶ wai‚Ä¶
Flora: Wait!
Flora: Please don‚Äôt leave meeee!
Trace: Claws‚Ä¶ digging into my back‚Ä¶ pain‚Ä¶!Tom: What the-? Oh‚Ä¶
Tom: Please excuse the interruption, we seem to be having technical difficulties.
Tom: Don‚Äôt worry, though, we should be up and running.. eventually.
[Flora = Cute, not evil!!]
Tom: In the meantime‚Ä¶
Tom: This is a good opportunity for me..
Tom: ‚Ä¶to read some fanmail!
Tom: Let‚Äôs see.. ‚ÄúHey Tom! Your comic is awesome, man. I love the art, and Flora‚Äôs teh cutest thing ever. One question, though. You say you‚Äôre a guy but your comic‚Äôs really sappy. Are you a girl in RL? And if not, why don‚Äôt you make Flora.. have‚Ä¶‚Äù
Tom: ‚Ä¶
Tom: Comics will be back Friday.Flora: Oh, no! I‚Äôm sorry! I didn‚Äôt mean to jump on you again.
Flora: Are you okay?
Trace: Yeah, I‚Äôm kinda used to it now.
Trace: So, does this mean you forgive me?
Flora: Hm‚Ä¶ I suppose. But only on one condition!
Trace: Name it! I‚Äôll do anything!
Flora: Then hold still‚Ä¶
Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Keith: Hmph, I need to clear my head. Where is that lake again?
Keith: Oh, there it is. Eh? Is that Flora and.. Trace?
Keith: What are they doing?!Narration: Keith-o-Vision
Trace: How‚Äôs this, Flora?
Flora: Oh, that feels great. Harder, harder!
Narration: Reality‚Ä¶
Trace: How‚Äôs that?
Flora: That‚Äôs better. But you can still brush harder. My fur isn‚Äôt that fragile.
Flora: Um‚Ä¶ Trace‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been wondering.. Do you think of me as just another Keidran?
Trace: What? Of course not. I don‚Äôt think of you as a Keidran at all.
Flora: Really?
Trace: But then again, you‚Äôre really the only woman I know‚Ä¶ I have nothing to compare with.
Flora: Oh‚Ä¶ right.
Trace: So‚Ä¶ want me to keep brushing?
Flora: Sigh, no, no. I think I‚Äôd better‚Äî
Trace: Wait‚Ä¶!
Flora: Huh?
Flora: (thoughts) W-what is he‚Ä¶ is he going to‚Ä¶?Narration: Four years ago‚Ä¶
Girl: Kei and I are going to play house.
Flora: Why kin‚Äôt I play house, too?
Girl: Duh, you‚Äôre a Keidran! You can‚Äôt be in a human family.
Trace: Flora?
Flora: Trace, I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Narration: One year ago‚Ä¶
Keiren: Flora, we can‚Äôt be friends anymore. It just isn‚Äôt normal, you know?
Flora: (thoughts) Why did it have to be a human again? I don‚Äôt want to re-live that‚Ä¶ But I like Trace. How can I know he won‚Äôt betray me too? ‚Ä¶I‚Äôll never find out if I keep pushing him away.
Flora: ‚Ä¶..
Flora: ‚ô•!
Trace: Flora‚Äî mmmph?!
Flora: (thoughts) Oh, what the heck!Keith: This can‚Äôt be!
Keith: !!
Keith: It‚Äôs just not right! This goes against the basic principles of every known race! I have to stop them!
Euchre: No.
Keith: You!? What do you mean ‚Äúno‚Äù? Didn‚Äôt you see what they did?
Keith: Geh! Can‚Äôt you see what they‚Äôre still doing?
Euchre: Let them be. I‚Äôll talk to Flora later.
Keith: Oh, yeah? Do you really think you can stop me?Trace: Woah‚Ä¶
Flora: Oh, I‚Äôm sorry, Trace. I.. Ah‚Ä¶ ah‚Ä¶.
Flora: AH-choo!
Trace: Oh, no. You didn‚Äôt catch a cold, did you?
Flora: No, I think it‚Äôs just the water. It‚Äôs freezing, even for me.
Flora: H-hey! You don‚Äôt have to carry me again!
Trace: I know‚Ä¶
Trace: But I‚Äôd never forgive myself if you got sick.
Narration: Later‚Ä¶
Flora: I‚Äôm surprised you don‚Äôt mind the smell of wet fur, Trace.
Trace: Well, now that I think about it‚Ä¶ it is pretty bad‚Ä¶
Trace: Ow, ow! Hey, it was a joke! A joke! Watch the claws!
Flora: Hehe!Trace: Wow, I feel great today!
Trace: Too bad Flora isn‚Äôt up yet.
Trace: Oh, hey Keith! You‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt look so good.
Keith: Yeah, I.. didn‚Äôt sleep very well.
Keith: I got up early this morning and caught some fish for breakfast. I‚Äôve already had some, so you can take it.
Trace: Great! I‚Äôm sure Flora will really like that!
Euchre: Trace, my human is‚Ä¶ not good, but may I speak to you?
Trace: Oh, uh, sure! What is it‚Ä¶ uh..?.
Euchre: I am called Euchre. And‚Ä¶
Euchre: I saw what you did.
Trace: üíßEuchre: Trace, relax. I‚Ä¶ not fight you. Just warn..
Euchre: Flora is.. sister-like for me. It is easy to.. hurt Flora. Flora has hurt before. With you.. it is hard. I willn‚Äôt stop her. She is happy.
Euchre: But‚Ä¶
Euchre: I‚Äôll be watching you very closely, Mr. Templar.
Trace: Erg‚Ä¶!
Euchre: I know a lot more than I let on. Flora is counting on you, Trace, and if you ever hurt her‚Ä¶
Flora: (thoughts) Hmm.. that‚Äôs odd, I feel really.. different today. Not bad.. just strange. Oh well, I wonder if Trace is awake yet.. Teehee! I kinda wish he would have slept in my tent. That way I could‚Ä¶. oh! Er.. check on his bandages! Yes, that‚Äôs right.
Flora: Oh, good morning Trace!
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶?
Trace: G-good morning, Flora! Got ya some fish‚Ä¶ B-but be careful, it‚Äôs hot! Don‚Äôt want you ta‚Äî to burn yourself! Yeah, don‚Äôt want you getting hurt‚Ä¶Flora: Trace! Come here!
Trace: Eh, that‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶
Flora: Come on! Get back here!
Trace: No! Maybe later..
Flora: Why are you running away?
Flora: What‚Äôs wrong? Y-you don‚Äôt like me anymore?
Flora: N-nya‚Ä¶
Trace: Wait, Flora‚Ä¶
Flora: Waaaaaaa!
Trace: Oh, no! Flora! Are you‚Äî
Flora: GOTCHA!
Trace: Ack!Trace: Good morning, Keith!
Keith: Morning, Trace. ‚Ä¶Morning, Flora. We should get moving soon. Do you mind looking over the map with me again before we leave?
Trace: Sure.
Flora: (in Keidran) Good morning, Euchre.
Euchre: (in Keidran) Morning, Flora.
Euchre: (in Keidran) I see you‚Äôre getting along quite well with your new boyfriend, eh?
Flora: What! But how‚Ä¶ I mean, no! He‚Äôs not my boyfriend!
Euchre: (in Keidran) Flora, relax! I can‚Äôt understand you when you talk in Human that fast. By the way, congratulations on your first kiss, even if it was done in the Human way.
Flora: (in Keidran) Oh, you‚Ä¶ saw that?Keith: So, we‚Äôll be leaving Human Territory soon and reach the sea from here.
Trace: Sounds good.
Keith: Trace‚Ä¶ I need to talk to you about Flora.
Trace: What do you mean?
Keith: I‚Äôll be blunt. It won‚Äôt work between you two. I saw what you two did yesterday, and I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs your business, but‚Ä¶
Keith: I think I should warn you. Keidran aren‚Äôt like your human females. They aren‚Äôt monogamists ‚Äî they don‚Äôt commit to a single partner.
Keith: Flora may not even realize this about herself yet, but one day she will be drawn away from you.
Keith: Even if you overcame your differences, it won‚Äôt last.
Keith: She‚Äôll just end up hurting you.
Trace: You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about!
Keith: I know better than you might think!Euchre: Flora, remember what I‚Äôve always told you‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do fine. I trust this version of Trace, but‚Ä¶
Euchre: You must be careful. He‚Äôs not his true self. You have yet to see the real Trace, and you will not like it if you do. I pray that you never will.
Euchre: Flora‚Ä¶. I must leave you now.
Flora: Leave?! Why? I thought you were coming with me!
Euchre: I‚Äôm afraid not. Now that I am free, I have some business that I must take care of.
Euchre: I am sorry, Flora.
Flora: Nooo! Please, don‚Äôt leave me! You can‚Äôt!
Trace: (in Human) Flora? Are you‚Ä¶ eh?
Narration: Trace-o-Vision
Flora: (in Human) Euchre, you‚Äôre one sexy beast.
Euchre: (in Human) I am, aren‚Äôt I?Trace: Flora, come on. Keith says we need to go.
Flora: Oh‚Ä¶ alright.
Flora: Is there something wrong, Trace?
Flora: Something I did?
Trace: No. I‚Äôm fine.
Trace: Hey, Flora! Cut it out! I‚Äôm trying to be annoyed!
Flora: Come on, Trace. Why are you mad at me?
Trace: I‚Äôm not! I‚Äôm not! Jeez, you make it impossible for me to be moody.
Flora: Good!
Trace: And so we were off again‚Ä¶ I was kinda glad Euchre wasn‚Äôt coming‚Ä¶
Trace: Then again, maybe with him, we might have had more luck finding the city‚Ä¶Narration: Two weeks later‚Ä¶
Trace: We‚Äôre lost, aren‚Äôt we?
Keith: No, I just need a landmark‚Ä¶
Trace: Landmark? The only thing on the map is the word ‚ÄúFOREST.‚Äù You aren‚Äôt looking for a giant letter ‚ÄúT‚Äù or something are you?
Flora: Om nom nom‚Ä¶
Narration: 30 minutes later‚Ä¶
Trace: Ah, this isn‚Äôt working. Here, let me see the map.
Trace: Maybe I can figure something out.
Trace: Hm?
Trace: Keith? Where‚Äôd you go? Flora? Flora!
Trace: Where‚Äôd everyone go?Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace! Trace!! Oh, how could we lose him? What if he‚Äôs in trouble?
Keith: Flora! I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs fine. We just need some way to find him. Do you know his scent well enough to track it?
Flora: Oh, of course! But I‚Äôve never tried this before. Let‚Äôs see..
Flora: I think‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs over there!
Flora: Come on, Keith!
Keith: A-alright.. lead the way, Flora.
Keith: ‚Ä¶..Flora: Trace!
Keith: Hey, Trace!
Flora: Trace?
Flora: Um‚Ä¶ Keith?
Keith: Hm? Find him?
Flora: Er.. no‚Ä¶ I just realized‚Ä¶ this is the first time we‚Äôve actually been alone. I just wanted to.. uh.. ask you.. why do you.. um.. hate my kind?
Keith: ‚Ä¶.
Keith: Sigh.. it‚Äôs nothing personal, Flora. It‚Äôs just that we‚Äôre different races. I‚Äôm not supposed to even be talking with you.
Flora: Ah, so I guess ‚ÄúKeith the Basitin‚Äù hates me? So‚Ä¶ what about Keith the person?
Keith: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Flora: oh, no!
Keith: Huh, what is it, Flora?
Flora: I smell it.. a‚Ä¶ a Feral Keidran!
Flora: Hurry, we have to find Trace quickly!Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Trace: Hm‚Ä¶?
Trace: Flora!
Trace: Man, am I ever glad to see you. I thought I‚Äôd‚Äî
Feral Tiger: Grrrrrr‚Ä¶
Trace: Huh? What‚Äôs wrong?
Trace: Hm‚Ä¶ you look different somehow‚Ä¶
Feral Tiger: Grrrrrrrr‚Ä¶
Trace: But I‚Äôm not sure why‚Ä¶
Trace: Wait!
Trace: You‚Äôre not Flora!
Feral Tiger: Graaah!!Feral Tiger: Mrrrrraal!
Trace: Hey! Come on! What did I do to you?
Trace: Erg!
Feral Tiger: Grrrrrrrrrrr!
Trace: (thoughts) No! I can‚Äôt get angry! Not with what happened last time‚Ä¶ arg! I.. can‚Äôt fight her‚Ä¶ I.. guess this is the end. Never thought I‚Äôd die this way‚Ä¶ Being eaten by a Keidran. Everything‚Äôs getting dark‚Ä¶ this must be‚Äî wait‚Ä¶. What is she doing‚Ä¶?
Flora: Hey you!
Flora: Stop humping my boyfriend!Flora: Trace! Oh, no! did she hurt you?
Trace: I-I‚Äôm fine, Flora! (Did.. she call me her boyfriend?)
Flora: Are you sure? How ‚Äòbout here? Or here? Or down.. here‚Ä¶
Trace: Hey, get out of there!
Feral Tiger: Grrrrr..!
Feral Tiger: Nah!?
Keith: I wouldn‚Äôt if I were you.
Flora: Wait, Keith!
Flora: (in Keidran) Please, we don‚Äôt want to hurt you.
Flora: (in Keidran) We just want to help you.
Feral Tiger: Raarrrrrrrrr‚Ä¶..
Flora: (in Keidran) Can you understand?
Feral Tiger: Raahhhhh!
Flora: No, wait! Come back!
Flora: (in Keidran) Listen to me!
Trace: Should we.. go after her?
Flora: ‚Ä¶ No. It‚Äôs.. too late.Flora: The Feral Keidran‚Ä¶.
Flora: When a normal Keidran experiences a lot of mental trauma, sometimes.. Their minds will shut down, and they revert back to their primitive selves.
Flora: Occasionally, they will snap out of it, but‚Ä¶
Flora: After about a day, it becomes impossible.
Flora: They become just like any other animal, relying only on their instincts. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always feared.. becoming a Feral.
Flora: ‚Ä¶
Trace: Well, you don‚Äôt have to worry, Flora. Not while I‚Äôm here to help you.
Trace: By the way‚Ä¶ I was kinda wondering, why did that.. Feral.. you know‚Ä¶
Flora: Oh, the humping thing?
Flora: That wasn‚Äôt cause she was a Feral. It‚Äôs something that happens to all us female Keidran now and then.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Sirus: Euchre, what a surprise.
Sirus: You‚Äôre back a lot sooner than I expected.
Euchre: So it seems.
Sirus: I had thought you‚Äôd wanted to go with them. Why change it now?
Euchre: Hm‚Ä¶
Euchre: Flora‚Äôs so happy‚Ä¶ and Trace is‚Ä¶ surprising. I believe his intentions are good. They‚Äôll be fine.
Euchre: Besides, we have work to be done, don‚Äôt we? The final tower is almost complete.Trace: Come on, Flora!
Flora: No! I‚Äôll tell you later, Trace. I‚Äôm tired, I need some sleep.
Trace: But what were you ta‚Äî
Flora: Later! I‚Äôll tell you Later!

Flora: The last thing I want to do is explain to Trace about how Keidran sex works.
Flora: At least I don‚Äôt have to worry about ‚Äúthat time of the year‚Äù anytime soon. I mean it‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ last time was‚Ä¶ Uhm‚Ä¶
Flora: Oh, crap.
Trace: Keith, I think something‚Äôs wrong with Flora.
Keith: Really‚Ä¶?
Trace: She said something about what Keidran go through every so often, but wouldn‚Äôt say anything else.
Keith: Wait.. you mean Flora is.. i-in‚Ä¶
Keith: Welp, I‚Äôm tired! See you in the morning!
Trace: Hey! Come back here! What‚Äôs going on!
Keith: I dunno, really!
Trace: You know very well, now spit it out!Narration: The next morning‚Ä¶
Flora: Well, it hasn‚Äôt started yet. I think I have a few more days to go. I just need to be honest with Trace.
Flora: Oh, good morning Keith.
Keith: Gah!
Keith: Sorry, Flora, I-I‚Äôm kinda in a hurry!
Keith: I‚Äôll see you later.
Flora: (thoughts) That.. was odd. What a weird guy.
Flora: ‚ÄòMorning, Trace!
Trace: ‚ÄòMorning, Flora!
Keith: (thoughts) Ack! She‚Äôs going after Trace now!
Flora: I just wanted to apolog‚Äî Hey!
Flora: Where‚Äôd everyone go?Keith: Phew!
Trace: Why did you pull me away?
Keith: I was saving your life! I should have explained it to you before‚Ä¶
Keith: Okay, female Keidran have this thing called ‚Äòheat‚Äô Which occurs about five times a year.
Keith: And during this time‚Ä¶
Flora: Aww‚Ä¶ kitty!
Keith: They pretty much have sex with anything that moves.
Trace: (thoughts) OMG CENSORED!
Trace: Wait.. so do Basitin go through this too.
Keith: ‚Ä¶No, why?
Trace: Well, then how do you know all of this stuff about female Keidran? Keith?
Keith: That‚Äôs none of your business.Trace: I really don‚Äôt want to avoid Flora. She might take it the wrong way.
Trace: But we can‚Äôt just.. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre‚Ä¶
Trace: Ah, this is confusing. Chances are it‚Äôs not even physically possible.
Flora: Mmmmrrraaahh!
Trace: Dear Lord, not again!
Trace: Nooooo! Don‚Äôt! I‚Äôm.. ah‚Ä¶ saving myself for marriage!
Flora: Aww, silly Trace. What‚Äôs the matter?
Flora: I pounce you all the time.
Trace: Yeah, but.. you‚Ä¶ Keith told me about your‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶
Flora: Oh, he told you about that?
Flora: Then you know this means we‚Äôll have to make the most of our time right now.
Trace: Right‚Ä¶ now?Flora: Come back, Trace! I wanna huggle you some more!
Trace: No! Wait‚Äî Ah!
Keith: ‚Ä¶ Stupid kids.
Keith: ‚Ä¶ Sigh.
Keith: Ah! Not again! This pain‚Ä¶ why does it keep coming back?
Keith: That‚Äôs it!
Keith: This letter has haunted me long enough. It‚Äôs time to complete my mission and fulfill the contract.Trace: So‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not a hormone-crazy tiger?
Flora: Naah! Well, not yet. Trust me, you‚Äôll know it when it happens.
Flora: But thanks for caring!
Flora: (thoughts) Well, that went better than I had expected! Didn‚Äôt even have to explain‚Ä¶ it.
Flora: (thoughts) Hm, I‚Äôm a little tired.
Flora: (thoughts) I think I‚Äôll take a nap ‚Äòtil we have to move on‚Ä¶
Flora: Huh? Hey, what‚Äôs that?
Flora: It‚Äôs in Keidran! A letter to‚Ä¶ Keith‚Ä¶ From‚Ä¶ his wife?!Flora: I really need to ask Keith about that letter‚Ä¶ Aaaah‚Ä¶ After I take a nap for a few hours.
Flora: Hm, it must be starting already..
Flora: Oh, well. Trace knows about it now. Hehe, maybe when he wakes up‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll..
Trace: Keith, I‚Äî
Keith: Trace, we need to get going. Where‚Äôs Flora?
Trace: Uh‚Ä¶ sleeping in her tent.
Keith: Well then go and wake her, we need to go.
Trace: Well, why don‚Äôt you wake her yourself?
Keith: What?!
Trace: Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs safe. She‚Äôs not how you thought she was.. for now.
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Keith: Fine, I‚Äôll go get her.Keith: Flora? You in there? Hello? Flora, wake up!
Keith: Hm, where is she? And what is that musky smell? Seems familiar‚Ä¶ like a Keidran in..
Keith: !

Keith: She‚Äôs.. asleep?
Keith: Get off me!
Flora: Naaaaaah!!
Flora: Ow.. ah.. wha did.. you d-do tha‚Ä¶ sniff Wha.. na‚Ä¶ wha‚Ä¶ did‚Ä¶
Flora: nahhhh‚Ä¶.
Keith: Wait, no! Don‚Äôt cry!Keith: I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ sorry, Flora.
Keith: I really didn‚Äôt mean it. Here, this should help.
Flora: Oh, dat‚Äôs okay. Id‚Äôs ma faut.
Keith: No, it isn‚Äôt. Is there something I can do to make it up to ya?
Flora: Well, actually, I was wondering if you could tell me.. where this came from?
Keith: Where the hell did you get that!?
Trace: Hey, what‚Äôs with all the shout‚Äî
Flora: No, don‚Äôt hit me again!
Trace: ‚Ä¶what.. do you think you‚Äôre doing to Flora?!

Flora: No, don‚Äôt!
Trace: Huh? Flora? I can‚Äôt get revenge if you cling to my legs like that!
Trace: Hey, where‚Äôd he go?
Flora: Wait! Listen sniff to me. He didn‚Äôt do it on purpose! Really, he was helping me.
Trace: But your nose!
Flora: It isn‚Äôt bad, really!
Trace: Here, let me see.
Flora: Uh‚Ä¶ Trace?
Flora: T-Trace? What are you doing?
Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Keith: huff Why do I even bother running, I have nowhere to go. Why didn‚Äôt I just tell her the truth?Flora: M-my nose! You fixed it!
Flora: But how‚Ä¶?
Trace: I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not really sure. These powers are so amazing, though. I never dreamed I could do things like this. And yet, it feels so natural‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶I need more‚Ä¶
Flora: T-trace..? What about Keith?
Flora: Huh..? Oh, Keith, right.
Trace: Hold on.
Flora: Trace, wait! What-?
Keith: There‚Äôs my tent.
Keith: I‚Äôll just wait in there for a while. Hopefully Flora will explain things to Trace. If not, I‚Äôll have my sword ready to explain it myself.
Trace: Hiya, Keith!
Keith: How the hell‚Ä¶?
Trace: Flora and I would like to have a word with you.Flora: Trace, cut it out!
Flora: Keith, please don‚Äôt be mad at me for reading that note. It‚Äôs just that.. you.. were you..?
Keith: Sigh, if you really must know, then‚Ä¶
Keith: After arriving on the mainland nearly starved to death, a group of Fox Keidran happened to find me.
Keith: They helped me, for some reason. Gave me clothes, and let me live with them as if I were their son. I was young and took all the help I could get. After a few months with them, I fell in love with their daughter.
Keith: I asked the parents if I could court her, and they agreed. It wasn‚Äôt all that unusual.
Keith: They did warn me about the ways of Keidran females.
Keith: But I ignored them, and 3 months later asked her to marry me. She agreed whole-heartedly.
Keith: Then‚Ä¶ two days before the wedding, she went out and never came back.
Keith: I left after I had heard she was sleeping with another Keidran. And that was that. Happy now?Flora: Trace, I feel so bad for Keith. I didn‚Äôt mean to bring back bad memories.
Trace: I know you didn‚Äôt, Flora, and I‚Äôm sure he does too.
Flora: It‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ if she loved him, why would she do that?
Trace: Well, Keith told me something a while ago.. that Keidran can‚Äôt‚Ä¶.
Trace: I know what he meant.
Flora: My mother once told me‚Ä¶ until I turned 14, I‚Äôd never be able to devote to just one person. I didn‚Äôt really believe her.. but.. I think it may be true. I.. I was supposed to be married before I met you.. Sythe‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve almost totally forgotten him. What.. what if the same thing happens between us?
Trace: I don‚Äôt want you to be unhappy, Flora.
Flora: I know‚Ä¶
Flora: But I‚Äôm happy with you!
Flora: Trace, I promise, I‚Äôll never hurt you like that.. never! I swear!
Trace: Okay, okay, Flora! I believe you.
Laura: Keith, I love you.
Laura: I promise, Keith. I‚Äôll never leave you.
Laura: Keith‚Ä¶
Laura: Keith, you know I‚Äôll never do anything to hurt you.

Chapter SixNarration: We finally managed to find our way out of the forest.
Narration: This city had an even larger tower ‚Äì and there was something strange about it‚Ä¶ the town seemed to
appear out of no where. But we didn‚Äôt complain‚Ä¶
Narration: Keith was still a little unhappy, but he was coming around.
Narration: It seems Flora and him had made up and were getting along better now.
Trace: How are you holding up, Flora?
Narration: Unfortunately‚Ä¶
Flora: I‚Äôm fine!
Trace: üíß
Trace: Oookay, if you say so.
Narration: Flora was four days into her heat, and with no relief, she was a little on edge.Sirus: Well, of course, Mr. Templar. I can have a ship ready for you as soon as possible.
Sirus: But it‚Äôs going to be at least a day to gather the supplies and men. I hope that‚Äôs alright?
Trace: Oh, uh, sure, sounds fine.
Sirus: Good.
Narration: Later‚Ä¶
Flora: Eh, Trace, I don‚Äôt know about this‚Ä¶
Keith: Yes, I agree with Flora. We shouldn‚Äôt stay here very long. There‚Äôs something wrong with this place, anyway.
I feel it.
Trace: What else are we going to do, though? It‚Äôs going to take time to get the boats ready, and we have nowhere to
go. Don‚Äôt worry, as long as you guys stay with me, everything will be fine. Trust me.
Narration: One change of clothes later‚Ä¶
Keith: This is‚Ä¶ humiliating.
Flora: I dunno‚Ä¶ I like having Trace‚Äôs shirt on‚Ä¶ mmm‚Ä¶ Trace‚Äôs scent is on it.
Keith: Oh, no, not again‚Ä¶.
Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Templar Twin 1: There he is! It really is the Grand Templar!
Templar Twin 2: I told you I saw him!
Templar Twin 1: This is amazing! Should we go and meet him?
Templar Twin 2: No! Trace isn‚Äôt the kind of person you just walk up to! We should inform Saria first, anyway.
Templar Twin 1: Oh, yeah, Saria! I‚Äôll go get her, you keep watch of Trace!Trace: Flora, would you stop that?
Flora: !
Flora: Well, sorry! It‚Äôs not all that easy, I‚Äôm trying to control myself as best I can.
Trace: Yeah, but this is really not the right time.
Trace: I have a reputation here, you know.
Flora: I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ try harder, I guess. It‚Äôs just frustrating.
Flora: I know we haven‚Äôt been together very long, but‚Ä¶ You know‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I love you‚Ä¶
Trace: You‚Ä¶ love‚Ä¶.?
Flora: (thoughts) That was the first time I‚Äôve told Trace that I loved him. Maybe it was a mistake‚Ä¶
Woman: Grand Templar? I hope I‚Äôm not interrupting. I just wanted to tell you that I‚Äôm a big fan of yours! Um, I
also hope you don‚Äôt mind, but I went and brought your wife here. She‚Äôs been worried sick about you.
Trace: Oh.. uh.. thanks.

Trace: Where are we‚Äì erg, Your claws!
Flora: I‚Äôm a Keidran, remember? I can‚Äôt talk to you out there.
Flora: Grr‚Ä¶ why didn‚Äôt you tell me you were married? You knew, didn‚Äôt you?
Trace: I had no idea!
Trace: I don‚Äôt know anything about my past, you know that! I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs true or not, really!
Flora: Oh, I know. But if it‚Äôs true.. I‚Ä¶ what about me?
Trace: Flora. Flora! Relax. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just some misunderstanding.
Trace: Why don‚Äôt you let me handle this? They have running water here, you can go take a bath. You.. heh, could
use one.
Flora: Oh, okay‚Ä¶
Flora: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Flora: Wait‚Ä¶ Did he just say that I‚Ä¶ smell?

Trace: Are you okay?
Saria: Y-yes.. I‚Äôm fine. Please, continue.

Saria: Aren‚Äôt you going to go after her?
Trace: Huh?
Saria: I thi-think you should.
Saria: I don‚Äôt know who this Keidran is.. but.. I saw that look on your face as she left.
I can tell you‚Äôre going to regret it if you don‚Äôt.
Trace: You‚Ä¶ really think so‚Ä¶?
Trace: Ah‚Ä¶. Yeah, you‚Äôre right.
Trace: (thoughts) What‚Äôs wrong with me? How could I do that to her?
Trace: I need to go talk to her. I‚Äôll be back in a few minutes.
Saria: I‚Äôve‚Ä¶ waited so long.. to see you again, my love. This body of mine‚Ä¶ can hold on‚Ä¶ just a little longer.Tavern Guest: Get out of there!
Tavern Guest: You crazy Keidran! Ya can‚Äôt just run in and take a room like it was yours!
Tavern Guest: You flea-bitten animal! I‚Äôm telling you, get out!

Tavern Guest: Ah!
Tavern Guest: Grand Templar! I-I didn‚Äôt know she was your Keidran, me Lord. Keep the room, it‚Äôs fine!

Flora: RAAAWR!
Trace: GAH!
Flora: I agree.Flora: Ever since we‚Äôve been here it seems like you‚Äôve been acting‚Ä¶ different. Giving me orders and ignoring
what I say. I hate it. It‚Äôs almost as if you really think of me as your slave.
Trace: Flora, that‚Äôs not true‚Ä¶
Flora: I know‚Ä¶ or.. I think I know. But it really does hurt. I don‚Äôt want to be treated like I used to be, as
a slave.
Trace: Flora, I‚Äôm really, really sorry.
Trace: I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve been acting like this recently. It‚Äôs just that.. you‚Äôre a Keidran, we have to pretend
at least.
Flora: Yeah, I know.
Trace: But I‚Äôll be easier on you from now on, I promise.
Flora: Mmhm‚Ä¶
Trace: Flora?

Flora: But why not?
Trace: You know why. I‚Äôm not ready for this. Neither of us are. This just isn‚Äôt the time for it!
Trace: That‚Äôs better. Flora, I care about you. I don‚Äôt want to take advantage of what you‚Äôre going through.
Flora: Yes, I know‚Ä¶ er.. sorry‚Ä¶
Trace: Heh, that‚Äôs okay. I have to get back to Saria now. No hard feelings, right?
Flora: ‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶

Flora: A whole day?
Flora: Wow!
Keith: Yeah, I was‚Äì er.. Trace was getting worried.

Keith: Because I‚Äôm not.. eh‚Ä¶ affected by it anymore.
Flora: OH! Hehe, I‚Äôm sorry!
Keith: I need to go wash up‚Ä¶. you can get more food downstairs.
Flora: Hmmm‚Ä¶ did Keith say the food was this way‚Ä¶? I can‚Äôt remember‚Ä¶
Flora: ?
Flora: Mew?
Saria: Yes, that‚Äôs a painting of the old Grand Templar, before her sudden disappearance.
Trace: Oh.. I see‚Ä¶ I think I remember her‚Ä¶
Flora: Merrr‚Ä¶Saria: So‚Ä¶ what about that Keidran of yours?
Trace: Hm..? Oh, you mean Flora? Why do you ask?
Saria: Oh, no reason. I‚Äôm just curious as to how you managed to come across her.
Saria: It seems to me like you two aren‚Äôt exactly slave and owner, am I right?
Trace: Yes‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs right. I found Flora in the woods, shortly after waking up without any memories. I have to
admit.. we are friends. I know it‚Äôs not right, but she is. She has been the only person who I think has honestly
wanted to help me.
Saria: But‚Ä¶ there isn‚Äôt anything more between you two?
Trace: More? Uh‚Ä¶ what do you mean? Flora and I are good friends‚Ä¶ but she‚Äôs still a Keidran. How could there be
anything between us?
Saria: Hm, I guess you‚Äôre right.
Saria: She is, after all, just a Keidran.Woman: Oh, Flora, there you are! I‚Äôve been looking for you.
Woman: I hope you‚Äôve considered my offer. I‚Äôm sure you want to get back to your Keidran family. After all, you
are a Keidran. And I know a Keidran like yourself must want to be around other Keidran, am I right? You‚Äôll be
free to do Keidran things, all the Keidran time!
Flora: Nyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Woman: Hey wait, where are you going?
Woman: Was it something I said?
Keith: Hey watch it‚Äì Flora? Flora, what‚Äôs wrong?
Flora: Nyeh‚Ä¶. sob‚Ä¶
Flora: Why am I a Keidran?Keith: Er‚Ä¶ Hey, Flora. Come on, get up. Everything will.. uh.. turn out okay, I guess.
Flora: Sniff‚Ä¶ sob!
Keith: (thoughts) Aw, crap. I was never good at being sensitive.
Keith: Flora, enough, please. Get up. Even I can‚Äôt stand to see you like this.
Flora: Sniff‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry. I can‚Äôt help it.
Keith: Now, tell me, what‚Äôs wrong with being a Keidran?
Flora: Well, it‚Äôs just that Trace said.. he said that since I was a Keidran we could only be friends‚Ä¶ He seems
so happy with that ‚Äúwife‚Äù of his‚Ä¶ why not, she‚Äôs a normal human being. I just wish.. wish I was normal too.
Keith: Flora, listen to me carefully.
Keith: You are who you are. You can‚Äôt change that. We‚Äôre both covered in fur. We look different than humans.
But inside, we‚Äôre still people.
Keith: And if Trace can‚Äôt see that, maybe‚Ä¶ maybe he doesn‚Äôt deserve someone like you.
Flora: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Maybe you‚Äôre right, Keith.Narration: Later‚Ä¶
Trace: Oh, hey Keith. What‚Äôs up?
Keith: I can‚Äôt take it anymore. Trace! If you haven‚Äôt noticed, Flora‚Äôs been sulking since yesterday! How could you
say those things to her? Even if she is a Keidran. You could at least go up and ask if she‚Äôs okay.
Trace: Keith, what are you talking about?
Trace: I didn‚Äôt say anything to Flora. The only time I said anything about Flora was to Saria, yesterday.
Trace: I couldn‚Äôt tell Saria how I felt about Flora! I don‚Äôt even know‚Ä¶
Keith: Oh, I see..
Keith: Well, you‚Äôve still kinda abandoned Flora. I think you‚Äôd better go and talk with her.
Woman: Flora, are you in here?
Woman: It‚Äôs me again. I know I haven‚Äôt made a very good impression, but I can‚Äôt stand to see you sad.

Trace: What?!
Ephemural: Wrong, Keith‚Ä¶ I am only saying what Flora cannot. These are her true feelings..
Keith: Liar!
Ephemural: She needs to know that humans cannot ever be trusted. She is stubborn, but with my help, she will
realize it.
Trace: Let her go right now! Why are you doing this? What have we ever done to you?
Ephemural: It‚Äôs not what you have done.. It‚Äôs what you will do. There is a great war coming, with balance hanging
from a thread. You two will determine the outcome, but you cannot be on the same side!Narrator: Once she accepted my help, it was easy.
Flora: Wait‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs going on? You‚Äôre not‚Äì! Who.. what are you doing to me?
Ephemural: I needed her to willingly want my help, even if it was only for a moment. I have you to thank for that.
Trace: Why would Flora ever want your help? Why was she so unhappy?
Ephemural: You really have no idea.
Trace: Wha‚Äì?
Ephemural: Flora had fallen in love with you. A stupid little girl with a childish crush. And your words mean
everything to her.
Ephemural: ‚ÄúJust a Keidran.‚Äù Remember that?

Ephemural: But of course you don‚Äôt. That was before I stole your memories.

Trace: Ack!
Trace: Eep!
Ephemural: You used.. a crate‚Ä¶ I mean, really.. a crate? Come on‚Ä¶Trace: Agh!
Ephemural: Why won‚Äôt you just give up already? This would be so much simpler. There‚Äôs no use struggling! Just
forget about Flora!
Ephemural: Why won‚Äôt you fight me? Realize your true powers! Give in to your memories!
Trace: I‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt..
Ephemural: Why? I don‚Äôt understand.
Trace: It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs because I really do care.. about Flora. I wasn‚Äôt sure before, but..
Ephemural: But she‚Äôs just a Keidran! You could have any human female you wanted! Or if you‚Äôre into Keidran, who‚Äôs
going to stop you? You could have anyone!
Trace: But‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want a human. Or a Keidran! Don‚Äôt you get it? It‚Äôs not the race that‚Äôs important to me.
It‚Äôs just.. Flora.
Trace: Because..
Trace: ‚Ä¶I love her.
Ephemural: Y-you‚Äôre not supposed to say that! I saw the future! This isn‚Äôt what happens!Keith: Jeez, I wish there was something for me to do around here. I would help Trace.. but I don‚Äôt think I can do
much for him now.
Ephemural: I mean really.. a crate? Come on!
Keith: What‚Ä¶? Hey, it‚Äôs that red-haired guy from before‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt remember his name. What‚Äôs he doing?
Red: If I can just get close enough‚Ä¶ Maybe I can kill the host before she realizes I‚Äôm here..
Red: It may be all-powerful, but without a body, it won‚Äôt be able to affect us‚Ä¶
Keith: Hey, stay back!
Red: Ow! What was that for, you stupid Keidran?!
Keith: I‚Äôm not a Keidran, damn it!
Keith: But that‚Äôs not the point‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt hurt Flora! Let Trace handle this!
Red: Hah! Like I‚Äôm going to listen to an animal. Why should I care for the life of this ‚ÄúFlora‚Äù?
Keith: Grrr‚Ä¶.
Keith: If you hurt Flora, I will kill you.Ephemural: This is over.
Trace: Arg!
Ephemural: Even if you can admit you love her, she will never hear it while I‚Äôm here. And that‚Äôs all that matters.
Ephemural: My mission is done.
Ephemural: I will bring Flora back to her home, and seal her memories, just as I did with yours.
Trace: No, wait! You can‚Äôt!
Trace: This can‚Äôt be the end, can it? Flora‚Äôs memories.. Was it all for.. nothing?
Trace: Have I failed?
Karen: Trace, what are you doing? Stop her!
bonk!
Ephemural: What? Who is‚Ä¶
Ephemural: ?
Karen: You‚Äôre not gunna take that, are you? It took me forever to get this stuff set up! I wanna see blood-shed!
[GO TRACE!]
Maren: Karen, can‚Äôt you be serious for once in your life?Maren: Seriously, Trace. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, entirely, but you have to do something!
Trace: But I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt risk hurting Flora! I can barely move in any case‚Ä¶
Euchre: Maybe you just need a little help?
Trace: It‚Äôs you! Uh.. Euchre?
Euchre: I‚Äôm honored you remember me.
Euchre: I must say, I have to agree with this human.
Trace: What?! But‚Ä¶ what about Flora? You‚Äôre practically her brother!
Trace: Are you saying you would fight her too?
Euchre: Me? Heck, no! I‚Äôd be killed!
Euchre: Listen Trace, it‚Äôs true that the masks know everything. Past, present and future. But there‚Äôs one thing
that they cannot predict..
Ephemural: Who is this Keidran?
Ephemural: (thoughts)_ How does he know so much about us?_Ephemural: Erg‚Ä¶
Ephemural: You stay out of this!
CRASH!
Ephemural: Die, you mortal Kei‚Äì wait‚Ä¶!
Ephemural: What?! Where did you‚Ä¶
Euchre: Heheheh, looks like you‚Äôre a little too slow.
Euchre: Trace, listen to me. You cannot be afraid of the power you have. You control your powers, you cannot allow
them to control you any more. You can do great things. And horrible things. It‚Äôs all up to you, Trace.
Euchre: But you have to act. You must fight! I cannot fight her for you.
Ephemural: H-how dare you‚Äì!
Euchre: Catch!
Trace: Ack!
Euchre: Fight her, Trace. Get Flora back!Ephemural: Heheh‚Ä¶ very inspiring‚Ä¶ Euchre. Did you think so too, boy?
Trace: Wha‚Äì?
Ephemural: Are you ready to fight me‚Ä¶
Ephemural: ‚Ä¶for real this time?!
Trace: Crap, crap! What do I do?
Euchre: Trace? Trace??
Trace: What if I hurt her.. what if.. then I.. what..
Euchre: JUST‚Ä¶ ATTACK!
Trace: Aaaaaaaagh!
Trace: Huff‚Ä¶ those.. those pieces..
Trace: D-did I win?
Trace: Oh, wait‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Crap, I‚Äôm screwed.Ephemural: I wouldn‚Äôt try that again if I were you. You know, the reason we need our hosts is because we feed on
their energy. And every time you attack me, you force me to use up a little bit more of Flora.
Ephemural: Bit after bit‚Ä¶
Ephemural: She slowly turns into an empty shell of a Keidran‚Ä¶
Ephemural: Oh well‚Ä¶ Maybe that‚Äôs better for her after all‚Ä¶
Euchre: Hm‚Ä¶ She has a stronger hold on Flora than I had thought.
Euchre: If only I could help‚Ä¶ ..interfere‚Ä¶ but there‚Äôs nothing I can do‚Ä¶ I am bound by the rules‚Ä¶
Euchre: But‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure everything will turn out alright in the end.
Sirus: Don‚Äôt worry‚Ä¶ I believe I‚Äôve done enough interfering for the both of us.Sirus: How are things progressing?
Euchre: Not favorably, I‚Äôm afraid. Ephemural is once again trying to awaken Trace‚Äôs true self, and it seems to be
working.
Ephemural: How does it feel, Trace?
Ephemural: To be helpless? Weak? Unable to do anything?
Saria: The ground‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ moving..
Ephemural: How does it feel, to know you were able to kill hundreds of thousands of people‚Ä¶
Keith: This doesn‚Äôt look good..
Ephemural: And yet‚Ä¶
Euchre: Trace, please, don‚Äôt listen!
Ephemural: ‚Ä¶You are unable to save the life of one person‚Ä¶
Ephemural: ‚Ä¶Even when that person‚Ä¶
Ephemural: ‚Ä¶is just‚Ä¶
Ephemural: ‚Ä¶a Keidran‚Ä¶Sirus: Is it already too late?
Euchre: No‚Ä¶
Euchre: I do not sense that Trace has regained his memories‚Ä¶ However, this is also something I have never seen
before‚Ä¶ I believe Trace is in a transition.
Euchre: He still doesn‚Äôt remember anything‚Ä¶
Euchre: And yet he‚Äôs now discovered his power‚Ä¶ I fear that it is corrupting his mind.
Trace: Heheh‚Ä¶
Trace: I‚Ä¶ I had never imagined power could feel this good‚Ä¶
Ephemural: This.. this isn‚Äôt supposed to happen! What good will those powers do you anyway? You can‚Äôt hurt me
without going through Flora first!
Trace: Heh, I don‚Äôt need anything else except these powers‚Ä¶ Why should I care about Flora?Sirus: I don‚Äôt understand it.
Sirus: If Trace doesn‚Äôt remember, then why doesn‚Äôt he care about the safety of Flora anymore?
Euchre: You have to realize that Trace hasn‚Äôt been able to do anything to help Flora up until this point.
Euchre: Now that he has power, though, he‚Äôs lost sight of why he wanted them to begin with. All he wants is to
kill Ephemural.
Sirus: This is insane. You have to do something.
Euchre: You know I can‚Äôt do anything. I am not to interfere‚Äì
Sirus: You and your rules!
Sirus: Don‚Äôt you get it, Euchre? That‚Äôs Flora out there, your sister ‚Äì practically. Maybe Trace isn‚Äôt the
only one who‚Äôs let power get to his head‚Ä¶
Euchre: I did not make the rules‚Ä¶
Euchre: Sigh, you are right. Perhaps I have been worrying too much about these rules. I will interfere‚Ä¶ once..
Euchre: Trace is the one that must get Flora back‚Ä¶
Euchre: But I can point him in the right direction.
Trace: Hey! What the heck is this?
Ephemural: What the‚Äì?Euchre: Trace, you‚Äôve forgotten‚Ä¶
Trace: Where am I? How are you doing this?!
Euchre: forgotten‚Ä¶
Trace: (thoughts) Wha‚Ä¶ what the‚Äì! Flora! And the mask, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶
Trace: (thoughts) It‚Äôs gone! And we‚Äôre.. in the forest?
Trace: Hey, what‚Äôre you doing?
Flora: Grrrrrrrr‚Ä¶..
Trace: What‚Äôs wrong with you? Why are you growling like that?
Trace: Come on, Flora!
Flora: Gasp! How did you know my name?
Trace: Hey‚Ä¶ wait!
Euchre: Forgotten‚Ä¶
Trace: What was that, a vision? And I didn‚Äôt forget! I remember when that happened! It‚Äôs when I first met her,
so what?
Trace: (thoughts) What‚Äôs wrong with my powers? How can he be stronger?
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶
Keith: Die, Keidran!
Trace: What the‚Äì!?
Trace: Keith, stop it! She‚Äôs not the enemy‚Ä¶
Trace: Eh‚Ä¶ hey, where did they go.. not another one..
Trace: What are you, Euchre? Why are you showing me these things! There‚Äôs nothing wrong with my memories!
I haven‚Äôt forgotten‚Äì
Trace: ‚Ä¶about‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Flora‚Ä¶?
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶?Trace: (thoughts) I‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt believe I thought about letting Flora die‚Ä¶ The power.. it overwhelmed me‚Ä¶
What happened? How could I forget?
Trace: (thoughts) The whole point of me being here is for her‚Ä¶ Flora‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶ I.. um..
Flora: I remember this too, I think‚Ä¶
Flora: It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ our first‚Ä¶
Ephemural: Ahah! I see you‚Äôve chosen to break the rules.
Ephemural: But you know full well the consequences‚Ä¶
Ephemural: What a noble sacrifice‚Ä¶ ..for such a petty cause.
Ephemural: I hate having to strike you down while you are defenceless, however.. I have risked too much already.
Once you are out of the way‚Ä¶ I shall depart‚Ä¶ with this little Keidran‚Ä¶
Flora: Mrraaaahhhh!
Trace: Flora! What‚Äôs wrong? Wha‚Äì what‚Äôs going on?
Euchre: ‚Ä¶sister‚Ä¶Flora: Trace‚Ä¶
Keith: Trace, snap out of it! Trace?
Red: She‚Äôs on the roof! That‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm going after her.
Keith: No, you can‚Äôt!
Trace: The roof? Yes‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs like.. I can sense her now.. her thoughts. She‚Äôs calling me to her.
Sirus: That was completely unnecessary, Ephemural. That Keidran was an innocent‚Äì
Ephemural: No one is innocent. He knew the rules.
Sirus: We all break rules..
Ephemural: Not as long as I‚Äôm around.
Ephemural: Would you care to join him?
Sirus: Oh no, of course not. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of interfering with your work now. Especially considering
I already have.
Sirus: You know what this is, right? You‚Äôre wearing one just like it, you see.
Ephemural: What?! Where did this come from?Ephemural: ‚Ä¶This?
Ephemural: A little human bauble?
Sirus: Yes, but one of my own designs.
Ephemural: Hmph‚Ä¶
Ephemural: I don‚Äôt see what you thought you could accomplish with this little thing.
Trace: Flora‚Ä¶ Flora, can you hear me?
Trace: Please, tell me you‚Äôre still there. Flora?
Ephemural: Grr.. What is that human muttering about?
Ephemural: He should know by now that Flora isn‚Äôt‚Äì
Ephemural: eh‚Ä¶ Mew‚Ä¶?
Flora: (thoughts) Trace, when I first met you in the wood I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äì intentions were. But as we continued in
our travels ‚Äì you, a human of all people. It wasn‚Äôt until later that ‚Äì really love you. It‚Äôs so strange.
It seems like it h‚Äì quickly. I miss you Trace. I want you back. I ‚Äì I‚Äôve done a lot of fighting in the past
few weeks ‚Äì met ‚Äì that‚Äôs normal. I have never h‚Äì d a‚Äì together before. Trace, I ‚Äì
kn‚Äì feel the same way? I hope‚Äì when you said those mean words ‚Äì hurts. I don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äì
Keidran, but I can‚Äôt h‚Äì ‚Äìw‚Äì It‚Äôs just who I am. Bu‚Äì that I still love y‚Äì being a
Keidra‚Äì ‚Äìt you to worry ‚Äì lot. Sometimes ‚Äì was tougher. I can‚Äôt help it. ‚Äì you don‚Äôt
mind. I love Trace! I ca‚Äì don‚Äôt care who knows it! We‚Äì a little. But it‚Äôs not s‚Äì are you afraid of?
‚Äìd of me?‚Äì
Ephemural: Agh! What is this? What are all these thoughts?
Ephemural: No, get away! What‚Äôs going on? This is impossible!
Ephemural: AAAAAAAHHH!Trace: Huh? Where..? Where am I..?
Trace: Ack! Why am I naked!? What is this place?
Trace: Am I dead? ‚Ä¶huh?
Trace: Flora! But.. Er, is this another one of your tricks, Euchre?
Sirus: No‚Ä¶ not Euchre..
Trace: Who said that?
Sirus: I don‚Äôt have much time. Listen to me, Trace. In order to free Flora, you need to be able to reach her.
But you can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Sirus: However, the necklace‚Ä¶
Sirus: It links you two together. What you are seeing is her soul.
Sirus: This is your chance, Trace. If she truly loves you, she will hear it.
Trace: Flora!
Trace: Flora‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ time to wake up.
Trace: I know it‚Äôs a little late now‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ I love you too.Trace: Flora, I know it‚Äôs a little late now‚Ä¶
Trace: But‚Ä¶
Trace: I love you too.
Ephemural: Aaaarg!
Ephemural: Gah! You infuriating little pest! You‚Äôve gotten in my way for the last time!
Ephemural: I tried to be nice about this, Trace, but you leave me with no alternative.
Ephemural: I will make sure you never‚Ä¶ eh.. You.. nev.. wait‚Ä¶
Ephemural: What the‚Äì?
Mary: Having a‚Ä¶ bit of trouble, Neutral? I don‚Äôt find that ‚Äìcough‚Äì very surprising.
Ephemural: What? You again! What would you know?Mary: I.. know what it‚Äôs like to be tricked into your‚Ä¶ control.
Mary: You promised me my humanity back, but controlled me ‚Äìcough‚Äì as price for it.
Mary: Just as you did with that young.. Keidran.
Mary: My dear Euchre.. Because of him, your hold on that Keidran is fading.
Mary: It‚Äôs over, Neutral! You cannot use her soul for your magic any longer.
Mary: Soon you won‚Äôt be able to control her at all.
Ephemural: Why‚Ä¶ you.. little..
Ephemural: I can still make her kill you!
Trace: Get behind me!
Mary: Trace?! Where did you come from‚Ä¶?
Trace: Ephemural!
Trace: Leave them alone!
CRACK!
Ephemural: Gaaaaaaaah!!Raine: Mom, are you okay? You ran off and‚Äì
Mary: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fine! Look!
Keith: Flora!
Red: That‚Äôs impossible!
Karen: Woohoo! Flora!
Trace: Ah‚Ä¶! Flora!
Trace: You‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre alright‚Ä¶
Trace: Thank goodness..
Trace: Flora, wait! Look out for the edge!
Trace: Flora!Trace: Flora‚Ä¶
Keith: Thank goodness, he managed to get her. I was afraid I‚Äôd have to be crushed trying to catch her.
Keith: Darn that stupid Keidran. She‚Äôs going to give me a heart attack some day.
Raine: Isn‚Äôt it wonderful? He saved that poor little Keidran!
Mary: Quiet, Raine! Don‚Äôt you forget, the Keidran ‚Äìcough‚Äì are still our enemies.
Raine: Enemies? How can you say that? After you‚Äì
Mary: Enough! This.. is not the time. I still feel unsure about all this‚Ä¶
Mary: (thoughts) This all seems too easy‚Ä¶
Mary: (thoughts) But.. what if she really.. really is gone?
Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Trace: Ugh, Flora‚Äôs a lot heavier than I remember. I must be more tired than I thought.
Keith: Trace, here, let me help you.
Keith: Trace, I‚Äì Hey! wouldn‚Äôt you like me to help carry her? You look exhausted.
Trace: Trust me, Keith‚Ä¶ It would take a lot more than exhaustion‚Ä¶
Trace: ‚Ä¶to make me want to let go of Flora right now.Karen: Heya, Fuzzyears!
Maren: I demand you let me see Trace right now!
Keith: I‚Äôll tell you what I told everyone else. Trace and Flora are tired, so they‚Äôre both resting. The room is
magically sealed, so if you want to talk to Trace‚Ä¶ I guess you‚Äôll have to wait ‚Äòtil later.
Maren: How dare you? Do you know who I am?
Keith: Does it look like I care?
Maren: Why, if I could find a Templar that hadn‚Äôt run away, I‚Äôd‚Ä¶
Flora: Mew? mmm‚Ä¶ I just had the strangest dream‚Ä¶
Flora: Huh, Trace? Did‚Ä¶ he stay by my bed because he knew I was upset?
Flora: ‚Ä¶
Flora: Come on, Trace. Come to bed.
Trace: neh‚Ä¶ muh..
Flora: Shhh, no need to wake up. Just‚Ä¶ ‚Äìyawn‚Äì sleep.Flora: Mmm, goodmorning, Trace.
Trace: Flora! You‚Äôre awake! Thank goodness‚Ä¶ gah! What am I doing in your bed?!
Flora: Hehe, I couldn‚Äôt let you sleep in that chair all day, could I?
Trace: We can‚Äôt do this! Let me go!
Keith: Stupid Trace. What am I, a butler now?
Keith: Can‚Äôt wait ‚Äòtill Flora wakes up. Then we can get out of here.
Keith: Trace!
Keith: I got the stuff you‚Äì
Keith: ‚Ä¶wanted‚Ä¶
Trace: Oh.. um, thanks Keith.
Flora: Heya, Keith!
Keith: yeah.. um.. no problem.. Sorry about‚Ä¶ interrupting‚Ä¶
Trace: Keith wait, it‚Äôs not what you‚Äì ah..
Flora: Hehe, or is it?
Trace: Wha‚Äì ack! Hey, get off me! Noo! Keith, don‚Äôt leave me in here with her!
Flora: Mrrawr!Trace: I‚Äôll be back in a little bit, Flora.
Trace: What‚Äôs up, Keith? You said you needed me for something?
Keith: Yeah, Trace. It‚Äôs Euchre.. she.. it‚Äôs just gone.
Trace: Gone?
Keith: Yeah! As well as the rest of.. well.. I think you should take a look for yourself. Out the back, so those
other humans don‚Äôt see you.
Trace: ..What?! Where did all this come from? How did we end up back in the woods?
Keith: Trace, that whole city‚Ä¶ I think it was an illusion‚Ä¶ only an image of a city that once existed.
Trace: An illusion? Made by who?
Keith: I‚Äôm not sure.. Neutral, probably. I scouted around, and I‚Äôve found this place on your map. It‚Äôs been marked with a‚Ä¶ strange symbol‚Ä¶
Trace: Strange?
Keith: Yeah‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve been getting a weird feeling around here.. Does this place seem familiar to you?
Trace: Yeah, a little‚Ä¶
Trace: Why do you ask?
Saria: Trace‚Ä¶
Trace: Huh? Saria?
Saria: Trace, may I.. speak with you in private? I have something that I.. must tell you.Saria: I always loved this old place. We used to‚Ä¶ come here all the time‚Ä¶ to your cabin out here in the woods.
That was of course‚Ä¶ before you became‚Ä¶ power hungry. We even came here when the border got close.. when it became
dangerous, because of the Keidran.
Saria: Do you remember any of this?
Trace: ‚Ä¶no, can‚Äôt say I do‚Ä¶ sorry.
Saria: ‚Ä¶good. I think it‚Äôs for the best that you do not remember.
Trace: What? Why? I want to know about my past.
Saria: No‚Ä¶ please, this isn‚Äôt someplace you‚Äôd want to‚Ä¶ to remember at all.
Saria: But there is something I must‚Ä¶ I must tell you.
Saria: Trace.. I‚Äôm not.. I‚Äôm not your wife.
Trace: Buh?
Saria: I‚Äôm sorry Trace‚Ä¶ for all the lies I had to tell you. We did know each other‚Ä¶ a long time ago‚Ä¶
Saria: I came back because of Neutral. She brought me here. I had no choice, but‚Ä¶ I had to see you‚Ä¶
one last time. I‚Äôm sorry.Saria: (thoughts) Trace, seeing you in this brief moment in time‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶has brought me greater happiness than I
fear you will ever understand.
Saria: (thoughts) For a while.. I‚Äôd thought you‚Äôd never be happy again.
Saria: (thoughts) But seeing you with that girl‚Ä¶
Saria: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶I am glad you‚Äôve found someone that can make you smile once more. Even if she is‚Ä¶ a Keidran..
Saria: (thoughts) I hope you will forgive me someday, Trace.
Saria: (thoughts) I just.. couldn‚Äôt bear‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt bear to burden you‚Ä¶
Saria: (thoughts) With the memory of my passing‚Ä¶
[Saria Legacy 449-477 Loving wife of an honorable Templar, killed by Keidran. May your soul rest, and your death one
day be avenged. ‚ÄîTrace Legacy]Templar: Trace is alive.
Templar: The Grand Templar knew and tried to kill him. The Council is not happy.
Sirvitine: Yes, I heard the news. He was located only a few miles from the Keidran border. What does The Council
plan to do?
Templar: As you know, Trace is needed in order to finish the final tower. The Council knows that they must find
Trace as quickly as possible. Should Trace die, or find his ways into the claws of the Keidran‚Ä¶ it would be
disastrous. This is why we‚Äôve chosen to employ.. the Dragons.
Sirvitine: Dragons?
Sirvitine: They can‚Äôt be serious! Sending a Dragon near Keidran territory.. It could be considered an act of war!
Sirvitine: Not to mention the fact that the king would never approve it. He wouldn‚Äôt allow us Templar that kind of
gold. You know what the Dragons ask for.
Templar: That won‚Äôt be a problem for long, Sirvitine. Once we have Trace in our hands and the final Tower
completed‚Ä¶ The king will bow down to us.Trace: Saria told me we were right here, near the border.. And only about 15 miles away from the port.
Maren: Trace, listen to reason.
Maren: Do you even know what you‚Äôre doing? Trace, come back with us to the Templar. We can help!
Trace: I‚Äôm not going back! At least not yet. I have other things I have to do.
Maren: And what‚Äôs that, Trace? Helping these.. animals?
Trace: They aren‚Äôt animals!
Maren: Listen to me, Trace. You don‚Äôt have any place to go! We‚Äôre dangerously close to the Keidran! You can‚Äôt keep
wandering out here.
Trace: I can‚Äôt go back to the Templar either!
Red: Trace‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre going to go, you‚Äôd better go now. The Templar will think to look here. After all, you
used to live here.. before‚Ä¶
Trace: What‚Ä¶?
Red: Nevermind. Maren, get Karen. We have to go too. The Council is calling all Templar back to the stronghold.
Maren: Hey, whose side are you on here? And why would the Council do something like that?
Maren: They‚Äôve never called all of you back before.Red: Trace, I think you should go. After everything you‚Äôve been through‚Ä¶ I think you need some time for yourself.
Red: Ever since four years ago, you‚Äôve been kinda obsessed about the Templar.
Maren: Well, you‚Äôre certainly being unusually insightful all of the sudden.
Red: Yeah, I know. Well, what are friends for, anyway?
Maren: Friends? Hah! He probably doesn‚Äôt even know your name.
Mary: Trace, good luck on your journey. You‚Äôve surprised me, Trace. So much change.. even in four years.
Mary: I can‚Äôt forgive you for what you did to me, but I thank you for saving me from Neutral.
Trace: Um‚Ä¶ no problem.
Keith: Hey, I packed all the supplies I could find, Trace. It‚Äôs not much though.
Trace: I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be okay, Keith. It‚Äôs only 15 miles. Should only take one night to get there. We‚Äôll be in the
port by morning.
Keith: If you say so.
Trace: Now all that‚Äôs left‚Ä¶ Where‚Äôs Flora?
Keith: She went back up to your room, I think. I‚Äôll get her.
Flora: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶home‚Ä¶
Keith: Flora, you in there?
Flora: Oh! I‚Äôll be right down, Keith.
Narration: Finally we were on our way again. Out of the old house, and into the Keidran Forest.Chapter 7 - InstinctsNarration: After a few hours‚Ä¶
Trace: It‚Äôs getting pretty dark.
Trace: I think we should just set up camp now. We‚Äôll get there in the morning.
Trace: This looks like a nice little clearing. As long as we follow the stream, we shouldn‚Äôt get disoriented tomorrow.
Trace: Flora, could you set up the lantern?
Keith: I‚Äôll get some wood for a fire.
Trace: Oh, could you also get some fresh water? I think we‚Äôre out.
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶?
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think we should camp out here.
Trace: Huh? What‚Äôs wrong, Flora?
Flora: Keidran have been here‚Ä¶ I can smell their scent.Trace: Flora, trust me. It‚Äôll be fine.
Trace: You and I have been through a lot in the last few days. Let‚Äôs just get some rest.
Flora: ‚Ä¶yeah, I suppose. The scent was kinda old, anyway.
Flora: I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be fine for one night‚Ä¶ hm?
Flora: Trace, where did this book come from?
Trace: Hey, wait! I can explain that‚Ä¶
Flora: What does it say?
Trace: Huh..? You don‚Äôt‚Ä¶?
Flora: I‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt read. I was never taught as a slave.
Trace: Well, um.. don‚Äôt worry about this old thing. It‚Äôs just an old story book.
Flora: Oh, it is?
Trace: Yeah, I found it at the house. Nothing you‚Äôd be interested in, I‚Äôm sure. Well, I‚Äôd better continue setting up camp.
Flora: Okay‚Ä¶ do you mind if I go for a walk?
Trace: Flora, you said it yourself‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs dangerous out there.
Flora: Aw‚Ä¶
Flora: Don‚Äôt worry about me. This is my territory.
Trace: I guess if you really want to.. but be careful. I‚Äôll drag you back by the tail if you get me worried about you.Flora: I can smell‚Ä¶ lots of scents here‚Ä¶ one familiar‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶
Flora: ‚Ä¶none of them are recent‚Ä¶
Flora: Maybe there‚Äôs some more over‚Ä¶ no, none here‚Ä¶
Flora: Wait.. what am I doing?
Flora: I should be happy I‚Äôm not finding anything‚Ä¶ More Keidran is the last thing we need.
Flora: Sigh‚Ä¶
Flora: I‚Äôm happy with Trace. Why would I want to put that at risk?
Flora: Why do I want to go home? Is it just because I‚Äôm a Keidran?
Narration: Meanwhile, in the trees‚Ä¶
Sythe: (thoughts) Flora‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve been a slave to the humans for too long, my dear.
Sythe: (thoughts) Not used to these feelings, are you? Without the power from those Templar buildings, your instincts are slowly becoming unsuppressed.Flora: Get ahold of yourself, Flora. Things have been tough, but you can do it!
Flora: As long as I have Trace, I‚Äôm fine.
Flora: Better get out of here before I run into a‚Äî
Sythe: ‚Ä¶a Keidran?
Flora: Mew!
Flora: Ow‚Ä¶ Sythe? Jeez, don‚Äôt sneak up on me like that. What are you doing out here anyway?
Sythe: Isn‚Äôt it obvious? I‚Äôve been looking for you, Flora. I‚Äôm here to bring you back home.
Sythe: Have you forgotten that we are engaged? Come on, take my hand.
Flora: ‚Ä¶.
Sythe: ‚Ä¶.
Flora: I‚Äôm not marrying you.
Sythe: It‚Äôs an arranged marriage. Neither of us have a choice.Flora: I don‚Äôt care what all those old grey-furs arranged for us. Neither of us really have feelings for each other. I want to lead my own life. I might be foolish, but it‚Äôs my own decision.
Sythe: Sigh‚Ä¶ fine, go then. I‚Äôll tell them I‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt find you or something.
Sythe: (thoughts) I didn‚Äôt want to be your enemy, Flora. I still care about you‚Ä¶ But.. I can‚Äôt risk my own life by coming back empty handed.
Sythe: (thoughts) I will bring you back, as ordered. But I can‚Äôt do it alone‚Ä¶
Narration: At the camp‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace, I‚Äôm back!
Trace: Huh, oh, hey Flora. You‚Äôre back sooner than I expected.
Flora: Yeah, I‚Ä¶ got tired. I saw some blue light while I was coming back‚Ä¶ was that you, Trace?
Trace: Uh, blue light? No‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ I have no idea.
Flora: Ah, okay. ‚Äîsigh‚Äî I‚Äôm just exhausted. It seems like all we do is travel around.
Flora: After all this is over.. I just want to go back home and settle down.
Trace: Yeah. I wouldn‚Äôt mind doing that myself. But we‚Äôll have to go our separate ways when that happens.
Flora: ‚Ä¶Yeah‚Ä¶ I know‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm going to go to bed. Is that my tent over there?
Trace: Actually, that‚Äôs Keith‚Äôs.
Flora: Oh.. but‚Ä¶ then where am I supposed to sleep?
Trace: Well, I haven‚Äôt actually set up your tent yet. And I‚Äôm kinda tired myself. So, I was thinking‚Ä¶
Trace: If you wanted to‚Ä¶ you could always‚Ä¶
Flora: Y-you mean.. you don‚Äôt mind if I sleep in your tent with you?Flora: But‚Ä¶ you always yell at me when I try to sleep in your bed‚Ä¶
Trace: Well, it was a little soon‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôve known each other for a while.. and I think it‚Äôs okay now.
Flora: Ah, okay‚Ä¶
Flora: It‚Äôs about time, Trace!
Trace: Heh, I‚Äôm still not really sure what‚Äôs going on. I assume this goes against all the codes of the Templar. But‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt remember any of that life I once had. And I don‚Äôt want to.
Flora: I know. I don‚Äôt want to be involved in this war. I just want to be happy.
Flora: ..hey, Trace?
Trace: Hm, what‚Äôs up?
Flora: Are we gunna.. well‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶?
Trace: Erm, well‚Ä¶Keith: Ugh, finally. Trace, it‚Äôs your turn to go on watch, I‚Äôm exhausted.
Keith: Huh, Trace? Now where‚Äôd that stupid human go?
Keith: Hm?
Flora: Ow, hey, that‚Äôs my tail, Trace!
Trace: Sorry, sorry.. never done this before.. how about now?
Flora: I know, me nei‚Äî eep! mm.. that‚Äôs nice..
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Keith: On second thought, I think I‚Äôll go scouting for a while longer.
Narration: Meanwhile, near a Templar outpost
Old Man: What is the meaning of this? It‚Äôs the middle of the night.
Servant: Master, I think you should see this. It‚Äôs a Keidran.
Old Man: Fine, show me.
Old Man: A dead Keidran? What does this thing have to do with me? Get rid of it!
Servant: He‚Äôs not dead, though I don‚Äôt know how. He has a huge stab wound.
Old Man: I still don‚Äôt understand why you needed me.
Servant: He mentioned your name. Your‚Ä¶ other name. Do you recognize him?
Old Man: (thoughts) Ah! It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs Euchre!
Servant: You know him?
Old Man: Yes.. he was a slave.. from long ago‚Ä¶ Quick, get him inside.
Servant: Yes, Master.
Old Man: (thoughts) It‚Äôs been a long time, old friend.Flora: Ow.. my head‚Ä¶ Where.. am I?
Flora: What the‚Ä¶? My hand! I have‚Ä¶ skin..?
Flora: Wha.. what‚Äôs going on? I‚Äôm.. human! I don‚Äôt believe it! I look like a human!
Voice: It is what you wish you were, is it not?
Flora: Gah! My feet.. what‚Äôs going on, I‚Äôm changing back!
Flora: No no no!
Flora: Please, let me stay human!
Voice: Why would you want to be something that you are not?
Flora: I.. I don‚Äôt want to be an animal!
Voice: You are not an animal, Flora. But neither are you human.
Flora: No!
Voice: You cannot change who you are.
Voice: You can‚Äôt hide your true nature..
Voice: ..forever.
Flora: ‚Äîgasp!‚Äî
Flora: (thoughts) Oh.. thank goodness. Just a dream‚Ä¶
Flora: (thoughts) Merr, Trace? Oh yeah, I‚Äôm in Trace‚Äôs bed. I still can‚Äôt believe we actually‚Ä¶ Hm..? Are those claw marks‚Ä¶ from me? Oh, I hope I didn‚Äôt hurt him. I have to be more careful next time.
Flora: (thoughts) Hm‚Ä¶ claw marks‚Ä¶ Animal.. ah, now I can‚Äôt remember what that dream was.Trace: hm‚Ä¶.
Trace: Hrmph‚Ä¶ Flora‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶huh, Flora?
Trace: Flora?
Flora: Over here, Trace. Good morning!
Trace: Oh, there you are. Good morning. What are you doing up?
Flora: Well, I just wanted to open up the tent and get some fresh air.
Flora: Unfortunately, the ground was all wet. My feet got pretty muddy walking around. It must have rained while we were asleep. And looking at the clouds, I think it might again.
Trace: Rain, huh? Well, I don‚Äôt really feel like walking around when it‚Äôs all wet.
Trace: So I guess we‚Äôre stuck in this tent for a while.
Flora: Yup, I guess so! And I don‚Äôt know about you, but I think I can come up with something to do to pass the time.
Flora: Though, I don‚Äôt want to add any more scratches..
Trace: I don‚Äôt mind, really!Pro-Human Mask: Welcome back, Ephemural. It‚Äôs been a while since you‚Äôve come to this realm.
Pro-Human Mask: You‚Äôve fallen apart. Just like your little race. It was a bold move, altering the mind of my warrior. You knew if you killed him, more would just take his place.
Pro-Human Mask: Instead you had him fall for the enemy. Now that‚Äôs clever.
Pro-Human Mask: Unfortunately, that little Keidran fell in love as well. When the time came, you couldn‚Äôt split them up. Now, without Flora, the Tiger an Wolf Clans have no alliance. Already, the wolves have chosen not to join the others, so sure that they can defend themselves.
Pro-Human Mask: One by one, the clans will fall. Until only my race shall rule this earth.
Ephemural: (thoughts) He may be speaking the truth. The outcome lies on the mortals now. My powers are weakened. I cannot risk attempting to enter the world again for some time.
Ephemural: (thoughts) But perhaps there is something I can do‚Ä¶ there is another race‚Ä¶ One that I have not allowed for many, many years.
Ephemural: (thoughts) I have no choice. I must ensure at least some Keidran blood survives. From this point forth‚Ä¶Trace: Flora, you asleep?
Flora: No, just resting.
Trace: I think we should probably start getting dressed soon. It‚Äôs the middle of the day.
Flora: Mmm, five more minutes.
Trace: ‚Ä¶Flora, do you think what we‚Äôre doing is wrong?
Flora: There‚Äôs nothing wrong with sleeping in once in a while.
Trace: Flora, you know what I mean.
Flora: The sex?
Trace: No, not just that, Flora. This whole relationship. It‚Äôs just not‚Ä¶ you know, normal. What if it just doesn‚Äôt work out?
Flora: Trace, I knew what I was getting into when I chose you.
Trace: But where will we live? And what about children? We‚Äôll never be able to experience parenthood. There‚Äôs so much we‚Äôll miss!
Flora: Trace, are you saying you don‚Äôt want me anymore?
Trace: What? No, no! I didn‚Äôt mean that‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace, I know‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll have to think about it eventually. But for right now, I‚Äôd rather just lie here with you.
Flora: Everything else will work itself out.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Sythe: You sent assassins to kill Flora too? Why!?
Wolf: There‚Äôs no need to shout. I may be old, but my hearing is fine.
Wolf: Nephew, you know I have never liked this arrangement with the tigers. We wolves don‚Äôt need help. So, we have decided to take this opportunity to break off from them. The tigers believe the girl to be lost. They will not miss her.
Sythe: A-are you mad? The humans would destroy us without the tiger‚Äôs aid!
Wolf: You impudent youth! I will not have you questioning me! Be quiet and know your place.
Wolf: And why do you seem concerned about the girl? You always said you didn‚Äôt like her anyway.
Sythe: ‚Ä¶yeah‚Ä¶ I did say that‚Ä¶
Zen: Damn it, he‚Äôs been sitting there all day! The targets have been in their tent for hours!
Zen: Why doesn‚Äôt he go in his?
Natani: Patience, brother. I told you, he‚Äôs a Basitin. Military people. They don‚Äôt get tired like we do.
Natani: If we try to kill him here, it might attract the others. We can‚Äôt risk being outnumbered.
Natani: But, there‚Äôs always a weakness. We need to lure him away from the camp. I‚Äôm sure a little‚Ä¶ persuasion will do the trick.
Natani: I‚Äôm curious to see what his heart‚Äôs desire is.
Laura: Keith? Keith‚Ä¶?
Keith: huh?
Keith: L-Laura?
Laura: Keith, it‚Äôs been so long‚Ä¶ Why don‚Äôt you come over here?
Keith: Laura‚Ä¶ how did you‚Ä¶ I thought I‚Äôd never find you‚Ä¶Keith: Would you get back here!? This isn‚Äôt a game!
Laura: Heheh, come on! Catch me!
Keith: Damn it! Stop, you stupid Keidran!
Laura: You‚Ä¶
Keith: Finally‚Ä¶ how‚Ä¶ how did you find me?
Laura: You promised not to call me that‚Ä¶
Natani: What the‚Äî why would his heart‚Äôs desire be a Keidran?
Zen: That‚Äôs not important. Just make sure you take him out, got it?
Keith: Hey! Hey! Don‚Äôt you dare start crying!
Natani: Oh, don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôm not taking any chances this time. I‚Äôll use the poison.Laura: Keith‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry. It‚Äôs awful, seeing how much you‚Äôve changed. It‚Äôs all my fault‚Ä¶
Keith: Laura.. it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs alright..
Keith: But why‚Ä¶? Why did you‚Ä¶ right before the wedding? Was it something I did?
Laura: No‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ My sister‚Ä¶ she hated that you were a Basitin. She also hated that I was marrying before her.
Laura: You know about that‚Ä¶ milk some Keidran drink? She gave me that‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt realize what I was doing.. I couldn‚Äôt help..
Keith: What?! She gave you‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ why didn‚Äôt you come back?
Laura: I‚Ä¶ I was too ashamed.
Keith: But if I‚Äôd have known, I wouldn‚Äôt have‚Äî
Keith: Wait‚Ä¶
Keith: Hold on, Laura. HEY! Whoever‚Äôs out there, show yourself! These ears aren‚Äôt just for decoration, you know!Laura: No, oh no! Keith!
Laura: Keith.. Keith.. please don‚Äôt die!
Laura: Keith!
Trace: (in Human) Did.. you just hear something, Flora?
Flora: (in Human) Yeah, that sounded like a girl‚Äôs voice..
Zen: Good job, Natani, that illusion of yours gave us away for sure.
Natani: The illusion only stays until the target is taken out. If your ‚ÄúInstant Death‚Äù poison worked better, the illusion would have vanished sooner!
Trace: (in Human) Hello? Who‚Äôs out here? Keith? Where are you? Flora, stay in the tent. I have a bad feeling about this‚Ä¶
Zen: Great, the crippled Templar is on guard.
Natani: Heh, you know what? I‚Äôm glad. I‚Äôve always wanted to see his power.
Zen: Nata‚Äî hey! Y-you idiot! We have to fight together!Trace: Keith‚Ä¶? Hey, whoever you are, show yourself. ‚Ä¶Maybe my imagination‚Äôs just getting the better of me. Yeah, yeah, no one‚Äôs out here.
Trace: Ack! Hey!
Trace: Aaah! Who the‚Äî gaah! Throwing knives?
Natani: Igniras!
Trace: ‚Ä¶oh crap‚Ä¶
Trace: Uh‚Ä¶ shield! Come on‚Ä¶! Shield!
Trace: Erg!
Natani: (in Keidran) So it‚Äôs true! Even without a reserve of mana, he can still gather it almost instantly‚Ä¶
Zen: (in Keidran) That‚Äôs how the Templar do it, they can draw the mana straight out of the ground.Natani: Clever, Templar, very clever. You have better control of your power than I thought!
Trace: Ugh‚Ä¶.
Trace: (thoughts) Need to‚Ä¶ heal myself while I can‚Ä¶
Natani: Not so fast, Human!
Trace: (in Human) No! It‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt work?!
Natani: Let‚Äôs see how well you fight without your magic!
Trace: Ah!
Trace: Grrr!
Natani: Pretty clumsy without your right hand, aren‚Äôt you?Natani: My human is not good. But I am called Natani. I kill you today. I am younger of the Magi Brothers.
Trace: Magi‚Ä¶ Brothers?
Trace: (thoughts) Wait, that means there‚Äôs‚Ä¶ two?
Trace: (thoughts) Erg‚Ä¶ this is gunna hurt‚Ä¶
Zen: And I am Zen! Now you die!
Trace: Ngh!
Natani: (in Keidran) What the‚Ä¶?
Zen: Graaah!Trace: Get‚Ä¶ back!
Natani: What?!
Zen: Graaah!
Zen: (thoughts) Damn it! I thought Natani blocked his magic! He won‚Äôt be so lucky again!
Zen: Uh‚Ä¶
Zen: Ah!!Natani: (thoughts) That wound is weakening him.
Natani: (thoughts) He must be losing a lot of blood.
Zen: Aaaah!
Natani: (thoughts) Time to finish him off‚Ä¶
Natani: Igniras!
Trace: Gaaah!
Trace: Agh!
Trace: Urgh‚Ä¶ t-that hurt‚Ä¶[Throughout my travels, I‚Äôve heard a lot of things said about the Basitin. Most of them weren‚Äôt too flattering.]
[But after the battle in the forest, three things I knew were certain.]
[One‚Ä¶]
[Basitin are tough. They can endure physical pain that could easily kill most other people.]
[I‚Äôve always found it remarkable, considering their small size.]
[Two, they are stubborn. Or thickheaded, as I like to say.]
[And probably most important of all, three: either by a gift from the gods or simply from thousands of years of living on an island full of deadly toxins, Basitin are, in fact, immune to most poisons.]
[Oh, they also seem to have a bit of a temper when aggravated.]Zen: Ooof!
Zen: Jeez, when they mentioned the girl, I never imagined her like this!
Zen: Hey, hold on a minute‚Äî Ah!
Flora: Graaahh!
Zen: Wait, listen‚Ä¶ listen to me! We don‚Äôt have to fight!
Zen: Come with us willingly! We were hired to kill you, yes. But‚Ä¶ but! We also support the merging of our clans. We don‚Äôt believe the Keidran can stand up to the humans without it!
Zen: If you go through with the marriage as planned, there‚Äôs nothing our leader can do to stop it.
Flora: I will not marry Sythe! I‚Äôm not going anywhere with you!
Zen: You selfish girl! Think of your people!
Natani: Oh, for goodness sake, we don‚Äôt have time for this, Zen!
Natani: We‚Äôll deal with her later.
Natani: For now‚Ä¶ Sleep!
Flora: Nya~!Flora: N-no, I‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Zen: Shouldn‚Äôt she have fallen asleep by now?
Natani: She‚Äôs resisting the spell! She has a stronger will than I thought. You‚Äôll have to take care of her the old fashioned way. I‚Äôve got to finish off Trace.
Zen: Kill her? But Natani‚Ä¶
Natani: Save it, Zen. I know how you feel about the alliance of the Clans, but let‚Äôs face it‚Ä¶
Natani: It‚Äôs not our job to question things. It‚Äôs our job to kill things.
Natani: And you know we really need this job. So just pick up your sword and finish her so we can get out of here.
Zen: Sigh‚Ä¶ alright. I‚Äôm sorry about this, girl. I really am.
Flora: N-nyeh‚Ä¶
Zen: But as much as I hate it, Natani is right. We Keidran are strong. We will survive against the humans. I will be sure to pray for your spirit‚Äôs release from this world.Natani: Now hurry up and take care of her while I finish this one.
Natani: I‚Äôve waited a long time for this, Trace. This is for all of my people‚Äî my family that you murdered in cold blood.
Zen: ‚Ä¶
Zen: Flora‚Ä¶ Flora! Listen to me. I‚Äôm not going to kill you. I‚Äôm just going to make it look like I‚Äôve killed you.
Flora: N-nya?
Zen: Listen, I know that spell is making you weak.
Zen: Just be sure to lie still. I became an assassin to fight humans, but I cannot kill someone like this.
Flora: W-what about Trace‚Ä¶
Zen: It‚Äôs too late for him. Natani‚Äôs about to finish him off. He‚Äôs just a human anyway.
Zen: (thoughts) This has to work. Flora must survive.
Zen: Prepare to die!
Zen: Gah!Zen: G-graah!
Natani: What‚Ä¶ Zen?
Natani: Zen!
Zen: Grah.. nlah!
Flora: (thoughts) You selfish child! Think of your people! I believe that without you, our race may die out! I‚Äôm not going to kill you. No.. this is wrong. My people‚Ä¶Trace (Journal): Journal entry, May 9th, 477 Mana is the basis of all magic in this world.
Trace: ugh‚Ä¶
Trace (Journal): Unlike Keidran, who must use mana stored in stones‚Ä¶
Keith: Grraah!
Trace (Journal): Templar have the unique ability to draw mana directly from the earth. However, once all the mana from one location is drained without time to replenish, it is the earth‚Äôs life-energy that begins to be drawn out.
Trace (Journal): This is also known as black mana‚Ä¶
Trace (Journal): It is a very powerful energy‚Ä¶ but most refuse to use it.
Trace (Journal): For there is always a consequence.
Natani: Teleport!
Zen: Augh‚Ä¶!
Keith: What the‚Ä¶?
Keith: You‚Ä¶
Natani: How dare you harm my older brother. You‚Äôll pay for that, Basitin.
Trace (Journal): From what I‚Äôve seen, taking life-energy from the earth often causes nervousness, violence, delusions, loss of memory, insanity and sometimes death. It worsens the more it‚Äôs used. I must be careful how much I use, I can already feel some of these effects taking hold on me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm taking Saria to our house near the Border this afternoon. She always loves it down there.
Trace: (in Human) Need more.. more mana‚Ä¶
Natani: I took out the great Trace Legacy. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be much of a‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶What is this? Why‚Ä¶ is the grass dying‚Ä¶?
[SARIA]Natani: Ah‚Ä¶!
Natani: You again! Don‚Äôt you people ever stay down?!
Natani: (thoughts) This is bad‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre both weakened, but with three against one‚Ä¶
Natani: What‚Ä¶ kind of magic is this?
Natani: It‚Ä¶ it looks just like the magic‚Ä¶ The magic of crystals formed from dying earth‚Ä¶
Natani: But that magic‚Äôs forbidden! It destroys the mind!
Flora: It‚Äôs happening again! But.. It‚Äôs stronger this time!
Flora: This isn‚Äôt good..
Natani: W-what is that?!
Natani: He‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs summoned a‚Ä¶!Villager: Man, everyday is the same thing‚Ä¶
Villager: (thoughts) I get up, I work, and I go to bed.
Villager: (thoughts) It‚Äôs so boring‚Ä¶ I feel like the character in a storybook that only shows up in one scene, doesn‚Äôt have a name, and is only used as a literary device in order to momentarily break away from the action.
Villager: (thoughts) In fact, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if there‚Äôs a group of people somewhere out there right now fighting a‚Ä¶ dragon or something. While I‚Äôm stuck here working in order to show another angle of the story.
Villager: This sucks‚Ä¶
Villager: Why can‚Äôt something exciting happen to me for once in my life!
Villager: Gah!
Villager: Woah, what the heck was that‚Ä¶
Villager: Storm clouds? But what‚Äôs that moving in them?Nora: Ah, there you are, my dear Trace‚Ä¶ Into trouble as always, I see.
Nora: A man-made dragon‚Ä¶
Nora: How cute‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace, come on! Snap out of it! Before that thing kills us all! Trace! Don‚Äôt let it control you‚Ä¶
Flora: Fight it, Trace! Can‚Äôt you hear me? It‚Äôs me, Flora‚Ä¶
Trace: Uuh‚Ä¶ F-Flora‚Ä¶
Flora: I‚Äôm here, Trace. I‚Äôm right here with you, always.
Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Natani: I-I just can‚Äôt fight something like that! No amount of gold is worth this!
Natani: I have to get out of here‚Ä¶
Natani: Gah‚Ä¶!
Keith: Going somewhere?Flora: Trace! Hey, get up! You can‚Äôt pass out now! This is bad‚Ä¶!
Flora: I‚Äôve got to do somethi‚Ä¶ huh?
Flora: Oh no, not again‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) Going to finish me, eh Basitin? Then do it!
Natani: (thoughts) There‚Äôs no way I can win against that demon, but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve still got two mana crystals left. If I can just get away from here‚Ä¶
Flora: (thoughts) They‚Äôre going to kill each other.
Flora: Keith, stop it!
Keith: This is my fight, Flora, stay out of it. And tell Trace to back off too, I don‚Äôt need his help to fight.
Flora: The dragon! I d on‚Äôt think Trace is in control of it anymore!Natani: Didn‚Äôt anyone teach you never to take your eyes off your opponent?
Natani: Igniras!
Keith: Agh-!
Keith: Actually no, they didn‚Äôt have to!
Keith: That‚Äôs instinct!Flora: (in Human) Keith, we have to get out of here!
Flora: (in Human) I‚Äôm sure that spell of his attracted the dragon‚Äôs eye. Can you carry Trace?
Keith: (in Human) Of course. What about‚Äî?
Flora: Forget about him, just go!
Natani: Uh‚Ä¶
Natani: That slice hit deep. I‚Äôm not going to make it out of here.
Natani: I guess this is my fate‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt seem to find my last crystal, I could have sworn I had another..
Natani: Not that it‚Äôd matter, I can‚Äôt concentrate long enough to cast a spell.. At least my last hours ended in battle..
Natani: Here it comes‚Ä¶ I guess this is the end‚Ä¶
Flora: Come on! Get up! Stop being so melodramatic!
Natani: Hey, I‚Äôm trying to give my dying monologue!
Flora: Oh please, ya big baby. That other guy had a sword go through him, get up!
Natani: Hey‚Äî what are you doing?Keith: Huff‚Ä¶ If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that I still need you for my mission‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd probably still save your ass. But then I wouldn‚Äôt have an excuse for it.
Nora: (thoughts) Hm‚Ä¶ looks like I‚Äôm going to have to interfere‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Burning the barrier of trees between Keidran and human territories can‚Äôt be good.
Nora: (thoughts) Oops, I think he noticed me.Flora: Come on, let‚Äôs go!
Natani: The forest‚Ä¶ my home, it‚Äôs burning!
Flora: There‚Äôs nothing we can do. I see the river over here, come on!
Natani: Grr‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt need your help! Why are you helping me anyway? I was just trying to kill you!
Natani: Huh? Where did she go?
Flora: I‚Äôm helping you because I don‚Äôt want more people getting hurt.
Flora: Your brother showed me that even assassins like you are people too. Besides, I saved your life. You me now. And I want you to help us.
Natani: Feh! How do you know I care anything about life-debts?
Flora: I think even someone like you still follows the code. But even if you don‚Äôt, what options do you have?Nora: Rooaaaarrr!
Trace: Ahhhh!
Keith: Trace, what‚Äôs wrong? Trace!
Nora: Heheh‚Ä¶
Flora: Keith, we‚Äôre here!
Keith: Flora! You‚Äî why is he with you?!
Natani: (in Keidran) What‚Äôd he say?
Flora: (in Keidran) Nevermind that now.
Flora: What‚Äôs wrong with Trace?
Trace: Ugh‚Ä¶
Keith: I don‚Äôt know, I can‚Äôt get through to him. maybe you should try. He seems to be in pain.Flora: Trace, what‚Äôs wrong?
Trace: Flora‚Ä¶ where are you‚Ä¶
Trace: I‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt see‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Finally, ‚Äîhuff‚Äî a break. Now if only I could find that darn crystal, I could get out of this forest‚Ä¶ This wound is still bleeding‚Ä¶ I need to hurry before those three notice I‚Äôm still here‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Ah, here it is! I knew I had one left‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Now I can‚Ä¶ transport myself‚Ä¶ I do feel sorry for her. Such an odd group of people.Natani: (thoughts) She‚Äôll most likely be killed out here. Not that I wasn‚Äôt about to kill her anyway.
Natani: (thoughts) But considering they fought off both me and Zen, it‚Äôs a shame they have to die now‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) No, no! I can‚Äôt be feeling sorry for them now!
Natani: (thoughts) My magic might help, but then I‚Äôd be stuck here too! No, I‚Äôll just go home‚Ä¶ They probably won‚Äôt die in the fire anyway. They could just get eaten.
Natani: (thoughts) Yeah, that really made me feel less guilty. I must be insane‚Ä¶ but she did save my life. The code says I must do the same‚Ä¶ ‚Äîsigh‚Äî fine‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) I will break the human‚Äôs mental link to the demon!
Flora: Ah! What‚Äôs happening to him, Keith?
Keith: It‚Äôs that Keidran! I knew you shouldn‚Äôt have helped him!Natani: There, that should‚Äî huh?
Natani: Wait, what are you?
Natani: Hey! Stop, I was helping you guys!
Keith: Like I buy that!
Natani: Stop it! Listen to me! I used my magic to break the‚Äî Er, why is the ground shaking?
Keith: Probably has something to do with that lousy spell of y‚Äî woah!

Trace: Yeah, I guess. My head hurts, though.
Trace: And I think I‚Äôm seeing things‚Ä¶ is that Keith‚Ä¶ on top of that guy?
Flora: Oh, so it is. Wow, I had no idea Keith was‚Ä¶ ya know, ‚Äúthat way.‚Äù
Keith: Hey, shut up! I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶ erm‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthat way!‚Äù
Flora: Hm, and I always thought he had a crush on me‚Ä¶ But I guess that can‚Äôt be possible‚Ä¶
Keith: What?! No, it can! I do!
Keith: Er‚Ä¶ wait‚Ä¶ no! I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Keith: Geh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not gay!
Natani: (thoughts) I can‚Äôt understand a word they‚Äôre saying, and something tells me I don‚Äôt want to know‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Shouldn‚Äôt we still be worried about the dragons overhead?Sirvitine: What a wonderful day!
Sirvitine: I‚Äôve finally got that whole tower explosion incident under control and back on schedule. And I hear they‚Äôre serving beansprout soup in the kitchen today!
Baron: Where is he!?
Baron: Hey, get over here! Where is he?
Sirvitine: Where is who‚Ä¶?
Baron: You know who I‚Äôm talking about, you stupid, dress-wearing scrivener! Your master! That fool you call the Grand Templar!
Sirvitine: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure, M-mr. Baron, sir. I think he might still be in his chambers.
Sirvitine: Oh‚Ä¶ I hope this doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with Lady Nora. I told Master he shouldn‚Äôt have employed that dragon. ‚Ä¶.. Hm, I think I‚Äôll go have some of that soup now.Flora: Trace, come on!
Flora: You have to get rid of the dragon you summoned!
Trace: Hey, get off me‚Ä¶
Trace: Wha‚Äî where the hell did that come from?
Flora: I told you, you summoned it!
Trace: Did I?
Trace: Well‚Ä¶ I guess if I summoned it, I can unsummon it. Come on. Let‚Äôs go, get up.
Flora: Trace, you sound different‚Ä¶Merry Christmas!Flora: Trace, what are you‚Äî
Flora: I need to concentrate!
Trace: I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm doing‚Ä¶ But if I cast that thing, I think I can take the energy back!
Nora: (thoughts) What‚Äôs this? I sense more magic‚Ä¶ Trace‚Äôs magic‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Something‚Äôs happening! The false dragon‚Äôs energy is being drained‚Ä¶ but where is it going? Surely‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Surely Trace wouldn‚Äôt be foolish enough to draw all that dark magic into himself!Flora: Trace, what‚Äôs wrong?
Trace: AH!
Trace: Ngh, I-I‚Äôm not sure‚Ä¶ It feels like I‚Äôve been burned‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Trace, I‚Äôll finish him off! Don‚Äôt go overboard like you usually do‚Ä¶!
Flora: Um‚Ä¶ Trace, did you‚Ä¶ hear that‚Ä¶? Trace‚Ä¶ th-there‚Äôs another dragon‚Ä¶ and I think it just talked‚Ä¶Old Man: It‚Äôs good to see you again, Euchre.
Euchre: As it is to see you, old master.
Keith: ‚Ä¶.
Flora: I think it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ landing‚Ä¶
Flora: Stay behind me!
Old Man: Please, don‚Äôt call me that. Even when you and Flora were on my farm, I never treated either of you like slaves.
Euchre: Sorry, old habits die hard.
Old Man: That was a serious wound you had. I‚Äôm still amazed how fast you recovered.
Euchre: I‚Äôm old‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve learned to protect myself from such things as death. Though‚Ä¶ I am at the end of my life, one way or another.
Old Man: Yes‚Ä¶ Aren‚Äôt we all.
Old Man: All of Keidran kind will be at its end if the final Tower is allowed to be completed.
Euchre: Clever, you Templar are. Using our own instincts against us‚Ä¶ a great tragedy is approaching.
Old Man: Yes, I‚Äôm afraid it is.Nora: (thoughts) There, now that that‚Äôs been taken care of‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve seen you‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Have you forgotten about me too, Trace?
Trace: Geh‚Ä¶ get back!
Nora: (thoughts) Don‚Äôt worry, little one‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) I‚Äôm not here to hurt you!
Trace: Gah‚Ä¶!Nora: (thoughts) Bleh! You taste like a Keidran. Smell like one too!
Nora: (thoughts) What have you been doing?
Nora: (thoughts) Trace‚Ä¶? Are you okay? You look a bit pale. Trace?
Trace: Gah!
Flora: Ack! Trace! Ah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve gotcha. Are you okay?
Nora: (thoughts) Oh, so you‚Äôre the Keidran I tasted‚Ä¶ Hello, I am known as Lady Nora.
Flora: Neh‚Ä¶!
Flora: Nyaaa‚Ä¶.Trace: Neh‚Ä¶?
Trace: Ugh‚Ä¶ where am I?
Trace: Gah‚Ä¶ my mind‚Äôs like sludge‚Ä¶ I remember that dragon‚Ä¶ Nora? Wait‚Ä¶ how do I know that name? Eh‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt think‚Ä¶ ah, well‚Ä¶
Trace: What‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ oh, Flora. Thank goodness. I wonder where Keith is? Well, Flora‚Äôs here. That‚Äôs all that matters.
Nora: (thoughts) Trace!
Trace: Wha‚Ä¶ who said that?
Nora: (thoughts) Good, you‚Äôre awake! I went hunting, I‚Äôll be right there, Little One. I decided to transport you to Haven Fields, just outside the forest. Town is just beyond that hill.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Baron: I‚Äôve found you at least, Head Councilman.
Head Councilman: So you have.
Baron: Herph, you Templar are all the same. You think your magic puts you above the law. Don‚Äôt think we aren‚Äôt aware of you! Dragons in the west, fires along the border, and war at our gates!
Baron: Have you forgotten that you still serve under the King? The Templar cannot simply take action on its own accord as it has!
Baron: The king will certainly see to it that you‚Äî ‚Ä¶ what is this thing doing in here?
Vehra: N-neh‚Ä¶ food?
Baron: Does it look like I want food right now?
Vehra: nya‚Ä¶ mehebeh‚Ä¶?
Head Councilman: Please, don‚Äôt mind her. She hasn‚Äôt been thinking clearly since being exposed to the Tower‚Äôs magic.
Baron: Hmph, yes, the Towers. Anyway, the King wishes to see you immediately.
Vehra: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Chapter 8 - A Peaceful RetreatNora: (thoughts) Trace, I‚Äôm here. Take it easy this time.
Trace: W-where are the others?
Nora: (thoughts) I considered eating them ‚Äî I was rather hungry, to be honest. But I assumed you want them alive. They‚Äôre just over here. I put them in the same magical sleep as she‚Äôs in right now, in order to transport you all here one at a time. Set her down ‚Äî I‚Äôd like to speak with you about your recent travels.
Nora: You‚Äôre a different person than you used to be, Trace. I‚Äôve never seen you so gentle with a Keidran‚Ä¶ she is your mate?
Trace: Mate!? Eh, no. Of course not! What would give you that idea‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Well, for one thing, you‚Äôre practically covered in her scent.
Nora: (thoughts) And well‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ may have taken a quick peek into your mind‚Ä¶
Trace: What?! You saw‚Ä¶?
Nora: (thoughts) Not on purpose! Though, it was quite interesting‚Ä¶Nora: (thoughts) Relax, Trace. It matters little to me who you choose to be with. I find it humorous how devoted that thing is to you, however. One look into her mind and it‚Äôs obvious her attraction to you.
Nora: (thoughts) No, what concerns me is the relationship itself. What do you play to do after this little adventure is over? Having a Keidran for a wife wouldn‚Äôt look good, you know?
Trace: Wife? Oh, no‚Ä¶ Marriage is‚Ä¶ um.. I wasn‚Äôt planning on that.
Nora: (thoughts) Is that so? You could always go back to the Templar‚Ä¶ you could keep her as a slave, if you wanted.
Trace: N-no‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt do that to Flora. She told me about her childhood and growing up. She wouldn‚Äôt stand for it, I‚Äôm sure. I don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre going to do. I really care about Flora, but‚Ä¶
Trace: The more I think about it‚Ä¶ the more I realize there‚Äôs really no place for us.
Nora: (thoughts) A human and a beast‚Ä¶ well, Trace, there is one place you could go‚Ä¶ The Orchard Valley.Trace: What is the ‚ÄúOrchard Valley‚Äù? Some‚Ä¶ town?
Nora: (thoughts) No, it‚Äôs not a town. It‚Äôs a place. It‚Äôs hidden far off, beyond the Basitin Islands, on the other side of the continent.
Nora: (thoughts) It‚Äôs a place beyond even the influence of the Templar.
Nora: (thoughts) The village itself is called Lyn‚Äôknoll. Ugly word, but it‚Äôs a combination of two languages. I do not think the Templar are even aware of its existence. But if they are, they don‚Äôt seem to be taking actions against it.
Nora: (thoughts) In the village, members of all three races co-exist‚Ä¶ relatively in peace. Not so many Basitins, of course. They have that stubborn pride.
Nora: (thoughts) I only know of the village because I had happened across it on one of my flights. They‚Äôve paid me quite well to keep their secret to myself, and make sure no one but the right people find it. But if you are looking for a place to get away from it all, that would be where to go. Simply travel beyond the shores of the Basitin Islands, once you‚Äôre done there, and you‚Äôll reach the Orchard Valley.Nora: (thoughts) Trace, I wish I could stay and help you, but I‚Äôm needed elsewhere.
Nora: (thoughts) Remember what I‚Äôve told you. There is still much you need to know. For now, I take my leave. I‚Äôve released your‚Ä¶ bestial companions from their sleep.
Nora: (thoughts) Goodbye, Trace!
Trace: Eh.. goodbye, I guess.
Flora: Neh‚Ä¶
Flora: Ah! Trace! The dragon, where‚Ä¶? Trace!?
Trace: Flora, relax. I‚Äôm right here.
Trace: The dragon‚Äôs gone now, it‚Äôs safe.
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace, you‚Äôre okay!!
Trace: Blarg!Flora: Heh, it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve done that‚Ä¶
Trace: Yeah, I was almost beginning to miss the feeling of being crushed. Come on, get up, we‚Äôve got to find Keith and get going. I want to get into town and find a boat before dark.
Flora: Sounds good! I‚Äôd rather not stay overnight in a human city again.
Keith: AHHHH!
Trace: What the heck was that? Sounded like it was‚Ä¶
Flora: Keith?
Narration: Meanwhile, nearby‚Ä¶
Keith: Hey, get off me! Jeez, wake up! Don‚Äôt rub against me like that!
Nora: (thoughts) Hm‚Ä¶ I just realized I forgot to check if those other two were a couple before I set them down‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶oh well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll sort it out.Natani: zzz‚Ä¶. s‚Äônah..
Narration: Later‚Ä¶
Flora: I‚Äôve asked him, Trace. He says he was sent by the wolf king to kill us. But‚Ä¶ the contract is off.
Trace: How does he know that?
Natani: (in Keidran) Zen and I are linked mentally. I see and feel what he does. Ever since he was stabbed, I have been using my energy to keep him alive. He‚Äôs now in the care of our healers. Without his aid, I‚Äôm not much of a fighter. My viciousness comes from his side of the link‚Ä¶ Zen is safe for now‚Ä¶ but since we‚Äôve failed, the king is going to banish us both. Or at least me‚Ä¶ Zen is safe until he‚Äôs healed..
Flora: (in Keidran) So‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have anywhere to go?
Flora: You could come with us‚Ä¶
Natani: Huh? With you guys?Natani: No‚Ä¶ no, I‚Äôm going back. I‚Äôll face my banishment.
Flora: But.. we can.. um..
Natani: Do you have a death wish?
Flora: W-wah?
Natani: Listen, I just told you I was sent to kill you guys. I‚Äôm a killer, obviously. And so is Trace, now that I think about it. Sure, you‚Äôre protected from me, because you saved my life, the Code, bah..
Natani: But there‚Äôs nothing stopping me from killing that human or that.. other guy in their sleep. What makes you think you can just trust me all of the sudden?
Flora: I.. I dunno. I‚Äôve just‚Ä¶ always believed that everyone has some good in them.
Natani: You‚Äôre a fool if you think that.
Trace: (in Human) I can‚Äôt understand a word they‚Äôre saying.
Keith: (in Human) Oh, Flora‚Äôs trying to get us killed in our sleep.
Trace: (in Human) What?!Natani: Good bye, Flora. Tell Trace to watch his back from now on.
Natani: Good luck, Natani.
Keith: Feh, more like good riddance.
Zen: Now why did you do that, Natani? You were supposed to go with them. They were about to trust you.
Natani: Oh shut it, Zen. I don‚Äôt care what the King‚Äôs offered, I‚Äôm not wasting my time on some crazy adventure.
Natani: (thoughts) Aw crap, what are humans doing way out here? They must be scouting out the fires.
Natani: (thoughts) I‚Äôm injured and have no weapons. There‚Äôs sure to be more humans in the forest.. well, I guess I‚Äôll go around.
Hunter: (in Human) Hey, there‚Äôs a Keidran! I bet it has something to do with this! Skin it alive!
Natani: I‚Äôve changed my mind!
Natani: I‚Äôll waste my time on your crazy adventure!Trace: Hey, these Keidran belong to me.
Hunter 1: Oh, sorry, we didn‚Äôt realize.
Hunter 2: You should really have them collared, and stay with them at all times.
Hunter 2: We‚Äôre close to the border, you know?
Hunter 3: Hey, wait a minute! I‚Äôve seen this guy before! He‚Äôs the one on the wanted posters set up two days ago! That Templar who went crazy!
Hunter 3: And that‚Äôs the Keidran on the other ones!
Trace: Buh?
[WANTED 500,000 Gold Runaway Templar Trace Legacy. Blue hair, blue eyes. No memory ‚Äî harmless]
Flora: Hey!
Flora: Flat-chested!?
[WANTED 25,000 Gold Runaway slave known as Flora. Tiger-patterned. Brown hair, flat-chested.]
Keith: Oh, for goodness sake, not another fight already!
Flora: Maybe we should try getting away?
Trace: Might be a good idea this time.Hunter 3: ‚ÄúGet away‚Äù? Not a chance! That gold is mine, you ‚Äòflat chested‚Äô Keidran!
Hunter 3: Gra‚Äî ah?!
Flora: You‚Äôll pay for that, human!
Flora: Well, I feel better. Now let‚Äôs get out of here!
Trace: Flora, remind me never to joke about that particular subject.Trace: We‚Äôve finally made it. ‚Ä¶for real, this time. I don‚Äôt like the looks of that tower, though.
Flora: Let‚Äôs spend as little time as possible, Trace. Bad things always seem to happen to us when we‚Äôre in these human cities.
Keith: That‚Äôs the least of our problems! How do you guys expect to get a ship?
Keith: You‚Äôre both wanted by the humans. And a traveling group of ‚Äòanimals‚Äô and a guy with blue hair isn‚Äôt exactly what I would call ‚Äúinconspicuous.‚Äù Unless there‚Äôs some huge distraction, I don‚Äôt see how we‚Äôre getting in.
Group Member: ‚Ä¶is that a firework‚Ä¶?Sirus: Greetings, citizens!
Sirus: Today marks the 171st annual Festival of the Beasts.
Sirus: As you can tell, I am not Guild Master Tarron. He has suddenly fallen ill, and won‚Äôt be joining us. I will be taking his place. My name is Edmund Sirus Templar VIII.
Sirus: It has been over three hundred years since our ancestors first met and feasted with the Keidran, right here in this very village. And though the rest of the nation would rather forget this event, we embrace it.
Sirus: For tonight, we welcome our bestial brethren to join us once again, and for one night only, in our joyous celebration and feast! Let the festivities begin!Natani: This is really odd‚Ä¶
Flora: Do you know what‚Äôs going on?
Natani: Well sorta. It‚Äôs the ‚ÄúFestival of Beasts.‚Äù Haven‚Äôt you heard of the old stories?
Natani: It‚Äôs said that over 300 years ago, the humans came here on a ship. The humans were naturally idiots and couldn‚Äôt tell food from their own dogs, so they began to die the first winter.
Natani: We generously gave the strange creatures our own food. After a while, it became a tradition, even after tension began to build between our two people. That is‚Ä¶ Until Trace came to power four years ago and screwed it up.
Natani: We haven‚Äôt had a festival in four years. What I find odd is that it‚Äôs started up again now‚Ä¶ The human‚Äôs Guild Master, appointed by Trace himself, put a stop to them, much to the disappointment of both sides.. I don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôre getting away with it this year, unless‚Ä¶ Guild Master Tarron is no longer in command.Flora: (in Human) Wow, everything‚Äôs so colorful!
Trace: (in Human) I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be noticed if we‚Äôre quick. Just blend in with the crowd and head to the docks.
Keith: (in Human) I still don‚Äôt like this‚Ä¶ That guy said there were wanted posters put up‚Ä¶ But I haven‚Äôt seen a single one‚Ä¶
Natani: Hey, watch out. Some idiot‚Äôs burning Subtleflower incense.
Natani: Don‚Äôt breathe too deeply.
Flora: You know‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre pretty‚Ä¶
Natani: Oh perfect, too late. Get a hold of yourself, we don‚Äôt have time for this.
Natani: And I‚Äôm not pretty!
Keith: ‚Ä¶you shouldn‚Äôt be so hard on yourself‚Ä¶
Natani: Oh no, not you too!Trace: The coast is clear, guys. Come on, pick up the pace‚Ä¶
Trace: Huh?
Trace: Flora? Guys? Where‚Äôd ya go?
Flora: Trace! Look, look!
Flora: Ribbons!
Townsperson: What a beautiful Keidran!
Eric: Pure breed, for sure!
Trace: Flora, what are you doing? You‚Äôre naked‚Ä¶ why did you take off your clothes!?
Flora: Hehe, I‚Äôm having fun!
Natani: (in Keidran) Trace! We must leave now! We can‚Äôt think straight! It‚Äôs the scents! I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm becoming increasingly attracted to random people!
Trace: I can‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶Trace: Flora, we‚Äôre trying not to attract attention! You being naked isn‚Äôt going to help!
Flora: Oh, relax, Trace. Just look around!
Flora: Nearly all the Keidran here are either naked or getting there by now.
Flora: In fact, I think you‚Äôre making us look suspicious! Let‚Äôs see what you have under those robes, Mr. Wolf!
Natani: (in Keidran) Hey, stop! I can barely control myself as it is!
Flora: Exactly!
Trace: Flora, don‚Äôt‚Äî! oh, what‚Äôs the use‚Ä¶
Eric: Excuse me‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs quite an exotic Keidran you‚Äôve got there. Might I inquire where you obtained such a creature?
Trace: Ya see, Flora? This is the attention we didn‚Äôt want!
Eric: Er, sorry‚Ä¶Eric: Would you and your Keidran consider joining me for a drink? I‚Äôd love to learn how you acquired such a variety of Keidran.
Trace: Er, no, sorry. We really can‚Äôt. We‚Äôve got to get to the docks.
Trace: Flora, leave Natani alone!
Eric: Looks to me like you won‚Äôt be getting there very fast.
Natani: (in Keidran) Stop! Hey, don‚Äôt tear the robes!
Eric: Trust me, a few minutes out of the scented air will do them some real good. And maybe I can help you get to the docks.
Trace: Oh, alright‚Ä¶ But just for a minute, then we‚Äôve gotta go.
Trace: Keith, come on. Give me a hand at breaking those two up.
Trace: Keith? Hello‚Ä¶?
Keith: (thoughts) Flora‚Ä¶ tail up‚Ä¶Trace: Come on, Flora‚Ä¶
Flora: Oh, Trace! Sorry, I don‚Äôt know what came over me‚Ä¶
Trace: Hey, hey!
Trace: No nuzzling!
Natani: (in Keidran) Well, that was certainly interesting. Nothing like being molested by a horny tiger.
Natani: (in Keidran) That was really close, too. I gotta control myself. If she had gotten my robes off in front of everyone‚Ä¶
Keith: (in Keidran) Hey, you, uh‚Ä¶ Need a hand, or‚Ä¶ something?
Natani: (in Keidran) No, no, I‚Äôm fine! I don‚Äôt need your help!
Natani: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶and I don‚Äôt need more temptation‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) Come on, let‚Äôs go!Eric: Here we are! Those Keidran should feel better almost instantly.
Trace: How do you feel, Flora?
Flora: A little better, I guess‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt control myself‚Ä¶ it was like my head was in a fog‚Ä¶
Eric: Oh, you speak very well! Great! I sure wish I had a Keidran like you in my.. eh‚Ä¶ collection‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd love to learn more about you and your history‚Ä¶
Flora: Well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm nothing special, really‚Ä¶
Eric: True, you‚Äôd be better if you were a bit more shapely and well-endowed‚Ä¶
Flora: Nya!!
Eric: Now that would be the perfect Keidran‚Ä¶!Keith: So, we‚Äôre inside.
Keith: We appreciate the help, but we‚Äôre in a hurry. We need to get to my island.
Eric: Ah, yes, the Basidian Islands.
Eric: Don‚Äôt see too many of your type here these days.
Eric: Allow me to formally introduce myself.
Eric: My name is Eric. I‚Äôm what you‚Äôd call.. a collector.
Eric: If you haven‚Äôt guessed, I‚Äôm a slave trader.
Eric: Obviously, my occupation gives me many opportunities to travel to far off places.
Eric: I don‚Äôt believe our encounter was chance.
Eric: I think that I can help you. You see, you‚Äôll have a very hard time trying to find any kind of boat during this festival. But perhaps if you‚Äôre willing to stick around ‚Äòtill tomorrow, I think I could arrange one of my own ships.
Flora: Aw man, we have to spend the night here? I have a bad feeling about this‚Ä¶ Something bad always happens to us when we‚Äôre in a human city‚Ä¶Keith: Trace, I don‚Äôt trust this guy at all. Someone is organizing these events, I‚Äôm sure.
Trace: You think it‚Äôs a trap?
Keith: I‚Äôm actually not sure‚Ä¶ Somehow, I think someone knows what we‚Äôre after.
Keith: What‚Äôs the chances that we‚Äôd meet a guy who happens to have a ship?
Trace: I dunno‚Ä¶ this guy seems pretty harmless.
Eric: You have the most wonderful fur pattern, my dear!
Flora: Erm, thank you.. I think‚Ä¶
Eric: I mean it! Your fur is absolutely lovely. It‚Äôs neat and clean, perfectly even‚Ä¶
Eric: Ah yes, the white fur goes all the way around.
Flora: Mer‚Ä¶!!
Trace: Ouch‚Ä¶ And now‚Ä¶ he seems pretty injured.Trace: Flora, stop!
Flora: Did you see what he did?
Eric: P-please forgive my rudeness. I truly did not mean to offend you.
Eric: I‚Äôm just used to inspecting my slaves in that way‚Ä¶ You see, most of the slaves I deal with are traditionally much more subordinate than you‚Ä¶
Flora: I‚Äôm not a slave! I was one once, a long time ago, but I‚Äôll die before I‚Äôm a slave ever again!
Eric: Oh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ But.. I don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶Eric: She isn‚Äôt a slave, then?
Trace: No, she‚Äôs not. Flora and I, along with the others, were simply traveling together to.. uh.. here.
Eric: Seriously?
Eric: I must admit I‚Äôm a little disappointed. I was really hoping to buy her from you.
Trace: Well, selling Flora is out of the question, even if I was able to. But we really need your boat‚Ä¶ is there anything else you want in return?
Eric: Well‚Ä¶ now that I think about it‚Ä¶
Eric: Boat rides can be very boring‚Ä¶ there is something Flora can do for me‚Ä¶ If she‚Äôs willing, of course‚Ä¶Eric: Voil√†! These are my paintings!
Eric: As I told you, boat rides can be long and quite boring. If you would model for me, I would love to paint your image.
Flora: Wow, these are really good‚Ä¶ you want me‚Ä¶ to model?
Eric: Sure, you have quite an exotic look to you.
Flora: Oh‚Ä¶ thanks, I guess‚Ä¶
Eric: ‚Ä¶and if you want, we can, ya know, have some fun afterwards.
Eric: A little‚Ä¶ private entertainment‚Ä¶Eric: O-ow‚Ä¶ I forgot, sorry. I‚Äôm not sure I deserved that, though. Eh, well‚Ä¶ My offer still stands. I‚Äôll take you aboard my boat in the morning if you want. If you don‚Äôt mind, I need to find my healing crystals, excuse me.
Trace: Well, what do you think, Flora? Should we trust him..?
Flora: Eh, as much as I hate to admit it, we need him. It‚Äôs the perfect opportunity‚Ä¶
Flora: But I‚Äôm not going to enjoy posing in front of him. You‚Äôd better make sure he doesn‚Äôt try anything.
Trace: I‚Äôll make sure‚Ä¶ And hey, we might as well make the most of tonight. We get to take a bath, sleep in a real bed‚Ä¶ And in the morning, we‚Äôll be sailing across the seas!
Flora: Yeah, that does sound kinda nice‚Ä¶ mrr‚Ä¶Trace: (thoughts) Well, looks like things have finally died down outside. ‚ÄîSigh‚Äî I wonder if I used to enjoy things like this.
Trace: (thoughts) Feh, not likely. From what I can tell, this would probably be something I would try to shut down. Still haven‚Äôt worked up the nerve to read the rest of my old journal.
Trace: ‚Ä¶they should have a festival for me‚Ä¶ These Keidran don‚Äôt deserve anything.
Flora: Hey Trace‚Ä¶
Flora: Come on, they finally got the water warmed up. Hey, what are you doing out here?
Trace: Oh, nothing‚Ä¶ just thinking, you know.
Trace: ‚Ä¶.murr‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt be so moody, Trace.Kat: Why, hello Mr. Trace. I am a servant of my master, Eric. I have finished preparing your bath. Shall I stay and help you with your bath? You‚Äôll find that I can provide you with a variety of‚Ä¶ services.
Flora: Hey, you hussy! Back off, he‚Äôs mine! Right, Trace?
Flora: ‚Ä¶Trace?
Flora: Oh, quit gawking! You don‚Äôt know where she‚Äôs been.
Kat: Hey! You don‚Äôt have to be rude‚Ä¶Flora: Nyah~!
Flora: Come on, Trace, get in here! Take that off, I‚Äôve already seen it all.
Trace: Alright, alright‚Ä¶
Trace: This is the first time we‚Äôve bathed together, isn‚Äôt it?
Flora: Unless you count that night in the lake‚Ä¶
Trace: Well, yeah, I suppose there was that‚Ä¶
Flora: Just relax, Trace. I‚Äôll wash your back for you.
Trace: Ah, now this is the life‚Ä¶
Kat: Ah, hello again Mr. Trace! If she‚Äôs got your back, I‚Äôll wash your front for you!Flora: You!! How did you get in here?! I thought I told you we don‚Äôt need you!
Kat: No, you said ‚Äúback off, he‚Äôs mine.‚Äù
Flora: Well we don‚Äôt need you, here to help us!
Kat: But I‚Äôve been ordered to help, it‚Äôs my job‚Ä¶
Flora: Who told you, that pervert? Figures!
Kat: Hey, Master Eric is not a pervert, he‚Äî
Flora: He is too! Why else would he send you in here to interrupt us‚Ä¶?
Kat: I don‚Äôt know, I just do as I‚Äôm told‚Ä¶
Flora: Well trust me, we‚Äôre fine, we don‚Äôt need your ‚Äúservices‚Äù
Kat: Hey, Master says I do well with my serv‚Äî
Flora: I don‚Äôt want to know about that stu‚Äî
Trace: Enough!!!
[BATH]
Flora: ‚Ä¶
Kat: ‚Ä¶
Flora: This is your fault‚Ä¶Flora: SAY IT!
Keith: NO WAY.
Trace: SAY IT, PLEASE?
Keith: I SAID ‚ÄúNO‚Äù!
Flora: SAY IT, OR NO CAKE!
Keith: WHA-? NO WAY‚ÄΩ
Trace: YUP!
Keith: FINE‚Ä¶
Tom: ?
Keith: H‚Ä¶ HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TOM‚Ä¶
Tom: WHY, THANK YOU!
Keith: CAKE, PLEASE!
Flora: EH HEH‚Ä¶ GOOD BOY.
Aiki: HAPPY B-DAY, TOM!Narration: Meanwhile, in the second bath‚Ä¶
Keith: I can hear yelling in Trace and Flora‚Äôs bath. What‚Äôs going on? Feh, well, it‚Äôs not my problem.
Keith: Finally, a chance to really relax. This is much better than the forest‚Ä¶
Keith: I think I‚Äôll just soak for a while.
Natani: (thoughts) Trace and the others are in the first bath.
Natani: (thoughts) I think this one is mine‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) It‚Äôs really steamy in here‚Ä¶ I can hardly see anything.
Natani: Ah, but it‚Äôs nice to finally get these heavy robes off.Natani: It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve taken these bandages off.
Keith: Hm‚Ä¶?
Keith: ‚Ä¶what the‚Ä¶?Keith: G-geh‚Ä¶
Natani: Huh‚Ä¶? Keith?
Keith: You‚Ä¶
Keith: You‚Äôre a‚Ä¶.
Keith: You‚Äôre a woman?!
Natani: What? No I‚Äôm not!
Keith: Then why do you have-?
Natani: They‚Äôre both lies! I‚Äôm a male! ‚Ä¶Shut up!Flora: I can‚Äôt believe Trace kicked me out of his bath. He seems really stressed out lately. I guess I should talk to him tonight about it.
Flora: Ah, there‚Äôs the second bath. I wonder if Keith is still in there? Heh, maybe I can bust in on him‚Ä¶
Natani: Listen here, I‚Äôm a guy!
Natani: And you‚Äôre not going to tell anyone otherwise!
Keith: Hey, it‚Äôs not my fault you barged in on me! I‚Äôm the one who should be angry!
Flora: Hey Keith, are you in he‚Äî ‚Ä¶buh‚Ä¶?!
Natani: ‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Natani: ‚Ä¶this isn‚Äôt what it looks like?Natani: (thoughts) If she sees my chest, she‚Äôs going to think I‚Äôm a girl too!
Keith: Hey, what‚Äî
Natani: Do you mind, Flora? We‚Äôre just two normal guys.. uh‚Ä¶ doing what guys do in a bath, you know.
Flora: Oookay‚Ä¶
Flora: Well, I gotta go‚Ä¶ do the thing‚Ä¶ so, see ya later‚Ä¶
Natani: Good, she‚Äôs gone. I don‚Äôt think she suspects anything.
Keith: Of course she does! She thinks I‚Äôm gay now!
Natani: Well, that‚Äôs not important. What‚Äôs important is that she doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a girl.
Keith: But you are‚Äî oh, forget it.
Keith: W-would you get off me now? Your rubbing is.. uh..
Natani: Yip!!
Natani: Please tell me that‚Äôs your tail between my legs!Natani: ‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Keith: If you want‚Ä¶ I can, you know.. uh.. help was your back or‚Ä¶ well, whatever‚Ä¶
Natani: Woof..?
Keith: I mean, just as a friendly gesture.. if you want‚Ä¶
Natani: Well‚Ä¶ sure, why not? I mean, I wouldn‚Äôt mind it, really‚Ä¶ Might be nice‚Ä¶Trace: Oh, Flora. I wanted to say, I‚Äôm sorry about kicking you out of the bath.
Trace: I was out of line. I hope‚Äî ‚Ä¶uh, Flora‚Ä¶? Is everything alright?
[BATHS]
Flora: Keith‚Ä¶ the wolf guy‚Ä¶ In bath‚Ä¶ together‚Ä¶
Flora: Keith is‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs‚Ä¶
Trace: Flora, what are you saying? You‚Äôre not speaking clearly.
Trace: What‚Äôs wrong with Keith?
Trace: He‚Äôs in here, you say?Flora: Trace, wait!
Flora: Uh‚Ä¶ I think we should just let Keith alone.
Trace: Oh.. okay. If you say so.
Trace: Come on, Flora. Let‚Äôs figure out from Eric where we‚Äôre going, then find out where we‚Äôre sleeping.
Flora: Good, it feels like this day has lasted for months.
Kat: Mr. Trace? Miss Flora? Where did you go?
Kat: I am here to assist you in anything you need!
Kat: Mr. Trace?
Kat: Are you in here?
Kat: W-what are you guys doing?!
Keith or Natani: Close the door!!
Narration: End.~ Chapter Nine ~
TROUBLED WATERSNatani: Nrrr‚Ä¶ ruff‚Ä¶Eric: I think I heard someone knock. Can you get that?
Kat: Nya‚Ä¶ no thanks.
Eric: Hey, now! What kind of servant says ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù?
Kat: Oops! I mean‚Ä¶ zZz‚Ä¶
Eric: I let that girl get away with too much. I miss when she was a kitten. She‚Äôs become a real handful now. I‚Äôve grown so used to her, though. Too attached. Alright, alright! Coming! Who could it be this early in the morning?
Eric: Oh, hey Roderick! What are you doing here at night?
Eric: Another Templar night mission?
Roderick: Hey, lil‚Äô bro. Yeah, they‚Äôre killing me!
Roderick: We spent all night looking for four people supposedly in this city, but no luck‚Ä¶Kat: Eric, who was at‚Äî O-oh, it‚Äôs you‚Ä¶
Roderick: Hey, if it isn‚Äôt my favorite slave, Spots! Come down here.
Roderick: Alright, now go that way and fetch me a drink.
Kat: Ow, stop!
Eric: Rod!
Kat: Okay, okay, I will!
Eric: I told you not to boss her around anymore. I bought her from you fair and square.
Eric: And don‚Äôt call her ‚ÄúSpots‚Äù. Her name is Kathrin.
Roderick: Eh, Spots is better. Relax. You‚Äôre too uptight.
Roderick: Anyway, let‚Äôs sit down. Here, see if you recognize anyone.Roderick: We don‚Äôt have a lot of info on the second pair‚Ä¶ But it turns out the blue-haired one is Trace Legacy, the former Grand Templar himself.
Roderick: It‚Äôs strange, I never knew what he looked like before now. For the last four years he‚Äôs generally been working in the shadows.
Roderick: We suspect he‚Äôs been captured and brainwashed by the striped Keidran.
Kat: Here‚Äôs your drink, sir.
Roderick: Heh, thanks kid.
Kat: N-no problem.
Eric: (thoughts) I can‚Äôt believe this‚Ä¶ Those four are all wanted by the Templar. But‚Ä¶ how could Flora commit these crimes?
Eric: (thoughts) She didn‚Äôt seem capable of it. Were they tricking me? Should I tell Rod?
Roderick: Bleh! What the heck is this? It‚Äôs piss warm!
Kat: I-I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ We have no ice or magic to cool it.Eric: Sorry, Roderick. I didn‚Äôt see any of these guys at the festival yesterday or last night.
Roderick: Aw dang. Well, thanks anyway.
Roderick: Just means they‚Äôll probably send me out some more today.
Roderick: Well, they‚Äôll expect me to report back. It‚Äôs good to see you again, bro. Stop by Dad‚Äôs house tonight, we‚Äôre having a party.
Eric: Sorry Rod, I can‚Äôt‚Äî hey, what are you doing?
Roderick: Heh, gotta give Kat something to do around here. You‚Äôre too soft.
Roderick: Right, Furball? Hey, I‚Äôm talking to you. Get over here.
Kat: ‚Ä¶No.
Roderick: Wha‚Ä¶ no?
Eric: Kathrin!Roderick: ‚ÄúNo‚Äù huh‚Ä¶
Roderick: Eric, you‚Äôre aware of the Templar laws. So what is this?
Roderick: You know that it‚Äôs against the law for traders to have slaves not bound by control spells. She shouldn‚Äôt be able to say ‚Äúno.
Eric: I‚Äôm aware of the laws, Roderick. I also know what they do to Keidran!
Eric: It kills them inside! I do use it for my slaves, but‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt do it to Kat. She‚Äôs been in our family since we were kids.
Roderick: Since you were a kid. Sigh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not going to argue with you. Run your business how you want. I‚Äôve got to get going.
Roderick: Just be careful Eric, other Templar might not let you off if they notice. Oh, and Kat‚Ä¶
Roderick: I‚Äôve known you for 9 years, and that‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve heard you speak up for yourself. I hate to admit it, but I‚Äôm honestly impressed.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Trace: (thoughts) Geh‚Ä¶? What‚Äôs licking my hair‚Ä¶?
Trace: Flora, what are you doing?
Trace: Neh‚Ä¶?
Flora: Eep!
Flora: Oh no! I didn‚Äôt mean to do that.
Trace: Flora, I told you! You don‚Äôt have to suppress your instincts around me.
Flora: But‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want you to think that I‚Äôm weird.
Trace: Trust me, Flora, it‚Äôs fine! I realize you‚Äôre a Keidran, and it doesn‚Äôt bother me.
Flora: I‚Ä¶ if you say so.Trace: (in Human) Hey Keith, Natani. I know it‚Äôs early, but we need to get going. We want to get on the boat before ten.
Flora: Natani, Trace is just saying to wake up. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre not in a hurry.
Natani: Meh‚Ä¶
Natani: M‚Äôkay‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm up‚Ä¶
Natani: Hey‚Ä¶ guy‚Ä¶ wake up‚Ä¶
Natani: Hey, wake up.
Natani: Neh, I hate mornings‚Ä¶
Keith: Huh? Hey! Get off me!
Keith: Ah great‚Ä¶
Keith: This is going to end up being my fault somehow.Eric: Hm, what should I do? It would be crazy to get on a boat with four wanted people.
Eric: There‚Äôs an awful lot of gold on Trace‚Äôs head.
Eric: I could be set for life‚Ä¶
Kat: Eric! ‚Ä¶Er, Master‚Ä¶
Kat: You aren‚Äôt going to turn them in, are you?
Eric: Well, why not? I‚Äôm a businessman, you know that. No one in their right mind disregards that kind of money.
Kat: But‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre already rich.
Eric: That‚Äôs beside the point. Why do you want to help them, anyway? You don‚Äôt know them.
Kat: Erm, well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen how they act with one another.
Kat: I don‚Äôt think any of them are capable of being criminals. And, um‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen how Flora looks at Trace. It kinda reminds me of‚Ä¶ of myself, sorta.
Eric: Hm? Yourself‚Ä¶?Eric: You‚Äôve never been this outspoken before. Why are you so adamant about me taking them?
Eric: Why should I go out of my way to help wanted people?
Kat: Well, you wouldn‚Äôt really be going out of your way. After all, you were planning on travelling after the festival anyway.
Kat: You‚Äôre always going to other towns, visiting‚Ä¶ your other servants. I was thinking maybe I could go with you this time, and help you out‚Ä¶
Eric: So, let me get this straight‚Ä¶
Eric: You want me to travel out to sea on a boat for a month with a couple of criminals‚Ä¶ All because my slave wants to come along?
Kat: Oh‚Ä¶ sorry, Eric. You‚Äôre right, that is stupid.
Kat: I-I shouldn‚Äôt have said anything‚Ä¶
Kat: Sniff‚Ä¶ Whimper‚Ä¶
Eric: ‚Ä¶
Eric: Oh‚Ä¶ fine. Go check if they‚Äôre awake yet.
Kat: Yay!Trace: Flora, are you‚Äî Huh‚Ä¶ where‚Äôd you go?
Trace: Flora?
Flora: Hey, I‚Äôm up here Trace.
Trace: A fourth floor?
Trace: I don‚Äôt think you should be wandering around. Eric might not like it. What are you looking at?
Flora: Look at the view he has from up here! You think we‚Äôll be on one of those monsters, Trace? I‚Äôve never been on a boat‚Ä¶
Trace: Well, it‚Äôs a long journey. Judging by the size of this house, I‚Äôd suspect it‚Äôll be quite a large ship.Kat: (in Human) You two enjoying the sunrise?
Trace: (in Human) Oh, yeah. It‚Äôs amazing up here.
Kat: (in Human) Eric wanted me to give you these. You‚Äôll want to wear these robes on the way.
Kat: (in Human) It‚Äôs going to be‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ cold once we get out on the ocean.
Trace: (thoughts) Hm, these robes will be good so we‚Äôre not detected‚Ä¶ But why do they want us to wear them on the way? Do‚Ä¶ they know we‚Äôre wanted? Is this a trap?
Kat: (in Human) W-why are you staring at me? You.. want those services now?
Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Natani: Can I talk with you for a second‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ Keith?
Natani: Can we just‚Ä¶ forget about yesterday and start over? Forget about me trying to kill you, and you trying to kill my brother, and‚Ä¶
Natani: You know‚Ä¶
Natani: That whole‚Ä¶ ugh, bath incident?
Keith: Um, sure.
Natani: Cause‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want more people thinking that I am‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶ you honestly believe you‚Äôre a guy, don‚Äôt you?
Natani: I am a guy! Truly!
Keith: ‚Ä¶Please don‚Äôt make me show you the difference.Natani: I realize what my body looks like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to talk about it.
Natani: Just don‚Äôt tell anyone what you saw!
Keith: Alright, alright. I just wish I knew why you hide it. You‚Äôre a lot more attractive without all the black robes.
Natani: A-attractive? No one‚Äôs ever called me that before‚Ä¶
Natani: Er, I mean, not that I care. I‚Äôm a guy.
Natani: I‚Äôm not supposed to look attractive, duh.
Keith: I see‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôm going to get ready. Don‚Äôt worry. I won‚Äôt tell your secret.
Zen: (thoughts) Aw, cute. You got a boyfriend.
Natani: (thoughts) Oh, shut up, Zen. I‚Äôve managed so far. I‚Äôm not going to give in to this female body now.
Zen: (thoughts) Is that so? Your tail‚Äôs been wagging ever since he called you ‚Äúattractive.‚Äù
Natani: Gah! Traitorous tail!Narration: Many years ago‚Ä¶
Young Natani: Sniff‚Ä¶‚Äú
Young Natani: Where are they? Mommy, Daddy, where are you? Please, come back‚Ä¶
Young Natani: They can‚Äôt be cone‚Ä¶ where did they go? Mommy, come back‚Ä¶
Zen: Would you just shut up, Natani!
Zen: Don‚Äôt you get it?! Mom and Dad are dead!
Zen: And they‚Äôre never coming back! Stop being such a girl about everything!
Zen: C-crying about it isn‚Äôt going to get us anywhere! We‚Äôve only got each other now, and we have to keep moving.
Young Natani: (thoughts) Sniff‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to cry‚Ä¶ I just want the pain to go away.
Young Natani: (thoughts) I wish I was like you, Big Brother.
Natani: (thoughts) Don‚Äôt worry Zen. I won‚Äôt let my emotions control me.Eric: (in Human) Everyone ready? Just give me a minute to put a seal on the house.
Flora: (in Human) Aw man, I hate robes! They really mess up my fur.
[CRYSTALS]
Natani: Hm‚Ä¶ crystals? Ah, finally! I‚Äôve been feeling naked without my magic.
Natani: Excuse me. How much are your crystals? Do they contain pure mana? I‚Ä¶ have a few pieces of silver here.
Crystal Vendor: ‚Ä¶..
Natani: You have no idea what I‚Äôm saying, do you?
Crystal Vendor: (in Human) No Keidran.
Natani: Sigh‚Ä¶
Natani: I understood that.
Keith: Come on Natani, we don‚Äôt want to attract attention.Eric: (in Human) Well, we‚Äôve made it.
Eric: (in Human) There she is, the Na‚ÄôRella.
Eric: (in Human) She‚Äôs not huge, but there should be plenty of room.
Keith: Hey Natani, wait.
Natani: Huh? Where did you go?
Keith: Here, just take this.
Keith: It‚Äôs the mana stones you wanted.
Keith: Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ just got them so you wouldn‚Äôt be complaining about them the whole time.
Natani: Oh, uh‚Ä¶ thank you.
Natani: (thoughts) Ah‚Ä¶ I feel strange‚Ä¶ W-why am I getting out of breath all of the sudden‚Ä¶?Master Seer: What are they doing now?
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: They‚Äôve just boarded the ship, Father.
Master Seer: Good, good, keep a watch on them. Be sure to get aboard as well.
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: I will, Father.
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: Mrrrow?
Nora: (thoughts) Hey there, Templar Kitty. Why don‚Äôt you take a break for a while? Follow Lady Nora‚Ä¶
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: F-father! I‚Ä¶ I can no longer control him.
Master Seer: What? Why not?
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: He was ambushed by a‚Ä¶ talking cat‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre doing‚Ä¶ bad things now.Eric: It‚Äôll be another hour or so until my crew is ready. Feel free to have a look around meanwhile.
Trace: Thanks a lot, Eric. We really appreciate you taking us along.
Eric: Eh, no problem. I was planning on sailing anyway.
Eric: The Basitin Islands are as good a place as any. Just don‚Äôt forget that deal we had. I get Flora to pose for my artwork on the way there.
Eric: Speaking of Flora‚Ä¶ I have to ask‚Ä¶ This trip is going to take nearly a month. Flora‚Äôs not in any danger of.. you know, going into heat during the trip?
Trace: What?! Eh‚Ä¶ no, she‚Äôs not. She went through that a while ago.
Eric: Ah, good. Kathrin‚Äôs safe too. That rules out all female Keidran.
Trace: Yup, all females here.
Eric: Indeed. Just the two.
Trace: But why does it matter?
Eric: Trust me, it‚Äôs just not a good idea. In a small area like this ship, it affects everyone.Trace: Come on, Flora. Let‚Äôs go check out our cabin.
Trace: Flora‚Ä¶? Are you alright?
Flora: I‚Äôm okay‚Ä¶ I just suddenly felt nauseous for some reason.
Trace: Oh no, you‚Äôre not getting seasick already? We haven‚Äôt even left port yet.
Flora: I know‚Ä¶ but, I think I‚Äôm alright now‚Ä¶
Flora: Urp, I think I spoke too soon‚Ä¶ Ugh, I wish the boat would stop swaying‚Ä¶ Back‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶
Flora: Uuueegh‚Ä¶!
Trace: Just.. uh‚Ä¶ let it all out, Flora.
Trace: (thoughts) I suppose this is the unglamorous side to a relationship.Eric: The harbor‚Äôs given us permission to shove off.
Eric: Alright, boys, let‚Äôs get some wind under our sails and get out of here.
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: Meow!
Nora: Huh‚Ä¶?
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: Meow! Meow!
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: Merrow!!
Trace: And so we were off once again, for four weeks of peaceful sailing. What could go wrong in a month at sea?
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: Meow! Meow!
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: Meow‚Ä¶! Meow‚Ä¶Narration: One week later‚Ä¶
Trace: Everything seems to be going well.
Eric: It‚Äôs been smooth sailing so far. If we keep this up‚Ä¶ I think this will be a very uneventful trip.
Eric: So tell me, Trace, how is Flora doing?
Trace: Oh, she‚Äôs alright. The first few days were a little tough on her.
Trace: But she hasn‚Äôt gotten sick lately.
Eric: Ah, good, good!
Eric: I‚Äôm glad. I‚Äôve been waiting for a chance to paint her. Do you think, perhaps, she could be available this evening?
Trace: Oh, right, the paintings‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd almost forgotten about that deal.
Trace: I suppose‚Ä¶ um, tell me‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not going to have her pose‚Ä¶ lewdly, are you?
Eric: Aw come on‚Ä¶ Do I seem like a pervert to you?
Eric: Just have her stop by my cabin in an hour, and I‚Äôll have everything set up.Flora: Erm, Eric? I‚Äôm here for the, uh, paintings‚Ä¶
Eric: Ah, Flora! Good to see you! Come in, come in. Close the door behind you.
Eric: How are you feeling?
Flora: I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ good‚Ä¶
Eric: There‚Äôs no reason to be nervous, Flora. I know we haven‚Äôt talked much in the last week, but we‚Äôre all friends here, right? You can trust me.
Eric: Now here, put this on.
Flora: You‚Ä¶ want me to change.. right here?
Eric: Why not‚Ä¶?
Flora: Well, ah‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just embarrassing!
Eric: Embarrassing? Aw, don‚Äôt be ridiculous! I‚Äôve never heard of a modest Keidran. Come on, just take it off. I‚Äôll turn around if it makes you feel better.Flora: You‚Äôre turned around, right?
Eric: Yeah, yeah, I‚Äôm not looking‚Ä¶
Eric: Directly, anyways‚Ä¶
Flora: ‚Ä¶eh?
Flora: Hey!!
Eric: Kidding, kidding! Ow, ow, hey!
Flora: Already, let‚Äôs get this over with.
Eric: Flora, what‚Äôs the big deal, anyways? I‚Äôve seen you naked many times in the last week.
Flora: Sigh‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not the nude thing, I don‚Äôt care.
Flora: It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it makes me nervous when you‚Äôre watching me undress. You really come across as a creepy pervert sometimes. Especially with that‚Ä¶ sex slave of yours.
Eric: What are you talking about? Kathrin? She‚Äôs not like that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never taken advantage of her.
Flora: Wait, you‚Äôve‚Ä¶ never‚Ä¶
Eric: No, not at all.
Flora: But‚Ä¶ you sleep in the same cabin!Flora: Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, Flora. I have spent‚Ä¶ ‚Äúquality time‚Äù with several of the servants I own.
Eric: But‚Ä¶ when our family acquired Kathrin, she was just a kitten. I was only ten at the time.
Eric: At first she was almost like a pet. But we got older‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt deny that we fooled around occasionally, we were kids after all. We were curious.
Eric: But‚Ä¶
Eric: I guess I just respect her too much to do that. She really means a lot to me‚Ä¶
Eric: ‚Ä¶I usually spend our nights teaching her how to read.
Flora: (thoughts) Huh‚Ä¶ maybe I had this guy all wrong. Maybe he isn‚Äôt such a pervert after all‚Ä¶
Eric: Well, enough about my past‚Ä¶ Hm‚Ä¶ I think this is a good enough warm up‚Ä¶
Eric: Now please take off your robes and bend over against that pole over there.Flora: I don‚Äôt know about this‚Ä¶
Flora: I knew this was bound to happen when I agreed‚Ä¶
Eric: Aw, come on, there‚Äôs nothing perverted about posing nude‚Ä¶ This is purely for artistic purposes.
Flora: ‚Ä¶you promise?
Eric: I swear. There‚Äôs no reason to be nervous.
Eric: Look at you‚Ä¶ Your tail is plastered between your legs. Come on, loosen up.
Flora: Uh, how‚Äôs that?
Eric: Well‚Ä¶ you could lift it a bit more‚Ä¶
Eric: ‚Ä¶a little more‚Ä¶
Eric: Maybe‚Ä¶ a little‚Äî
Flora: What kind of painting are you planning on making?!
Eric: Okay, okay! Tail down is fine too‚Ä¶Eric: Hm‚Ä¶ so tell me, Flora‚Ä¶ How did a Keidran like yourself end up traveling with Trace, a Human?
Flora: What do you mean‚Ä¶?
Eric: Well, it‚Äôs highly unusual for a Human and Keidran to be traveling together. Especially now that‚Ä¶ well.. war is so close.
Eric: It‚Äôs pretty obvious you two are a couple. How did that happen?
Flora: Huh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been so long‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶ he saved my life, when we first met.
Flora: I was a runaway. I was scared of him at first, too. I feared he would turn me in. But he never did.
Flora: And‚Ä¶ I guess I loved him for that.
Flora: We‚Äôve been traveling together ever since. Eventually one thing led to another and we‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ did as all animals do‚Ä¶ ahem.
Eric: (thoughts) Hm, Flora‚Äôs more attached to Trace than I first thought. I wonder if Trace feels the same way? ‚Ä¶well, at least I got her tail up again. This is going to be a good painting‚Ä¶Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Keith: Alright, no magic or weapons, just hand-to-hand combat. You ready?
Natani: Ready when you are.
Natani: And don‚Äôt even think about holding back against me.
Keith: After this is over you‚Äôre going to wish I did!
Evals: Hey, check it out.
Mike: Hm? Oh, yeah, they‚Äôve been training down here for the last couple days. Never seen ‚Äòem fight though‚Ä¶
Evals: Is that right‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶my next meal says the wolf guy wins.
Mike: You‚Äôre on.Natani: Grrrr‚Ä¶
Natani: Grrrah!
Natani: ‚Ä¶.gah?!
Keith: Watch your step!
Natani: Ack‚Ä¶!
Keith: What‚Äôs wrong, Natani? I thought Keidran were good on their feet?
Keith: Or was that just the felines?
Natani: Oh, har har, laugh it up. Just don‚Äôt get too cocky yet.Natani: Hm‚Ä¶
Natani: Graaah!!
Keith: (in Basitin) Oh, for the love of all that is holy!!
Natani: What‚Äôs wrong, Keith?
Keith: Hey, what kind of fair fighting is this?
Natani: As an assassin, I was never trained to fight honorably.Natani: Grrr‚Ä¶
Natani: Graah‚Äî ah?
Natani: Ah, hey! Lemme go! This isn‚Äôt fair fighting!
Keith: Oh, now look who‚Äôs complaining about fairness.
Natani: Grrr‚Ä¶ stop pulling my arms like that! Something‚Äôs tearing, it‚Äôs too tight‚Ä¶!
Natani: ‚Ä¶m-my bandages!Mike: W-what just happened? Did he‚Ä¶ just become a she? Did the Basitin do it somehow?
Evals: It must be black magic‚Ä¶
Keith: Eh? Uh oh, they saw‚Ä¶ black magic‚Ä¶? Hm.. Worth a shot‚Ä¶
Keith: Yes‚Ä¶! I used my Dark Basitin Magic to turn him into a woman! Or something‚Ä¶ So‚Ä¶ go away! Or‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll do the same to you! I guess‚Ä¶
Evals: Every man for himself!
Mike: Please, have mercy! We will go! We will go!
Mike: You do not know what Master Eric would do to us if you did!
Keith: (thoughts) Well‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs something I never wanted to think about.
Keith: (thoughts) But it worked better than I thought it would.
Natani: T-thank you, Keith. But I thought Basitin couldn‚Äôt use magic?
Keith: Oh, we can‚Äôt. But I figure those slaves don‚Äôt know any better.Trace: I know I shouldn‚Äôt be writing in this journal.
Trace: I should just throw it out. But I fear I‚Äôm losing myself. I‚Äôm irritated more often, and I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe if I record my thoughts, I can better ehold onto them. I do not want to end up like I once was.
Trace: I must focus‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace, I‚Äôm back! Oh, am I‚Ä¶ interrupting?
Trace: Flora, of course not. How did it go?
Flora: It‚Ä¶ was interesting.
Flora: He acted as I expected. But it wasn‚Äôt that bad. He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a polite pervert, I‚Äôm just glad to be back.
Trace: So, you don‚Äôt feel sick?
Flora: Nope! I still feel fine.
Trace: That‚Äôs great! After all you‚Äôve been through, I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre finally feeling well.
Trace: ‚ÄòCause you know‚Ä¶ You haven‚Äôt been in the mood all week!Flora: Oh, I see!
Flora: You only care if I‚Äôm feeling well so you can get into my pants! ‚Ä¶Er, so to speak.
Trace: No no no, Flora! I didn‚Äôt mean it like that!
Trace: I just misspoke. I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre well.
Flora: Hmph!
Trace: Aw, come on, don‚Äôt be that way! We can just sleep, it‚Äôs fi‚Äî
Flora: Rawr!
Trace: Ack!
Flora: Gotcha!
Trace: Yup, she‚Äôs back to normal‚Ä¶Narration: Week two‚Ä¶
Natani: I can‚Äôt stand this‚Ä¶
Natani: I feel like I‚Äôve been on this wretched boat for two eternities.
Keith: Natani‚Ä¶?
Keith: What are you doing up here? Please tell me you‚Äôre not howling at the moon.
Natani: No, I‚Äôm not howling!
Keith: I thought we were going to practice tonight. Anything wrong?
Natani: Wrong? What do you think?! I‚Äôm wet, I‚Äôm cold, and I‚Äôm hungry! We‚Äôre in the middle of an endless sea of water! Just get away from me and leave me alone!
Natani: I‚Ä¶ er, wait, sorry. I didn‚Äôt really mean that. I‚Äôve just been frustrated lately and I‚Äôm not sure why.
Keith: It‚Äôs alright.
Keith: I‚Äôm staying up for a few more hours. If you change your mind, come to my cabin and we can go at it.Trace: Is that your third serving?
Flora: Mmhm. I‚Äôve been so hungry recently. I‚Äôm not really sure why.
Trace: You‚Äôve also been pretty quiet. Anything wrong?
Flora: Mmmm, nope.
Flora: Well, actually‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been thinking‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve known each other for a long time now, right?
Trace: Heh, it feels like it. It‚Äôs only been a few months, though.
Flora: Well, that‚Äôs a long time for us Keidran, and well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been wondering‚Ä¶ I mean, even though it would be impossible to do‚Ä¶ have you ever thought about‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶
Flora: ‚Ä¶Marriage?
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶?Flora: Trace, relax! I didn‚Äôt mean it seriously! I was just speaking hypothetically. Ya know, if you‚Äôd thought of it.
Trace: Oh, well, no. I hadn‚Äôt really considered‚Ä¶
Trace: Well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm full! I.. think I‚Äôll go get some fresh air‚Ä¶ upstairs.
Flora: Oh, okay‚Ä¶
Flora: Sigh‚Ä¶
Keith: (thoughts) Crazy, gender-confused wolf-girl.
Keith: (thoughts) Oh, finally‚Ä¶ someone who‚Äôs relatively normal.
Keith: Hey Trace, what‚Äôs up‚Äî
Trace: I need help, advice, anything!
Keith: What?!Keith: Alright, so Flora‚Äôs starting to talk about marriage, huh? It‚Äôs not impossible. You can hold an unofficial ceremony if you like.
Keith: So what‚Äôs the problem?
Trace: We‚Äôre not the same species! Even if it‚Äôs unofficial, marriage is still a serious commitment, right?
Trace: And we could never have children. I don‚Äôt know.
Trace: It‚Äôs just.. she‚Äôs not human, you know? She‚Äôs.. well, an animal! Would it even be right to do? How is it going to work out with her the way she is‚Ä¶?
Trace: What would people‚Äî ah!
Trace: Hey, what are you‚Äî?
Keith: Are you even listening to what you‚Äôre saying?
Keith: What makes you any less animal than us, huh? What makes you humans so high and mighty?
Keith: I have no right to tell you what to do with your relationship. But I hope, for Flora‚Äôs sake, that you base your decision on who Flora is, and not just what she is.Trace: Get off me! You‚Äôre overreacting‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt mean it like that!
Keith: Oh, I think you meant it exactly as you said, whether you realize it or not.
Keith: To be honest, I don‚Äôt trust Keidran any more than the next guy. But Flora‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs different. I don‚Äôt want her hurt.
Trace: I‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt want her hurt either. I guess‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre right. I was wrong to say such things.
Trace: But I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶
Keith: Well, like I said, I can‚Äôt tell you what to do. But if you want my advice, I suggest you wait until you figure out who you really are.
Flora: Nya!
Flora: ‚ô•
Trace: Hey Flora, I‚Äôm back.
Flora: Hey, that was quick. Did you get that fresh air you wanted?
Trace: No‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt get what I wanted. But‚Ä¶ I think I got what I needed.Trace: Flora‚Ä¶ well, I guess we should discuss what you said earlier‚Ä¶
Flora: Oh right! Um‚Ä¶ What did I say earlier?
Trace: You‚Ä¶ you mean you don‚Äôt remember?
Flora: Er‚Ä¶ nope‚Ä¶ I thought we were just making idle conversation before you ran off‚Ä¶
Flora: Hm, let me think‚Ä¶
Trace: Er, n-no need! It‚Äôs okay! We can talk about it later, that might be better‚Ä¶
Flora: Oh, okay, if you say so, Trace.
Trace: (thoughts) Phew! I really didn‚Äôt want to get into that conversation. Is it wrong that I‚Äôm avoiding the question?
Trace: (thoughts) Sigh.. I promise you, Flora, I‚Äôll give you a proper answer soon, once I sort out myself.
Flora: (thoughts) Heh, I figured he didn‚Äôt want to talk about it.
Flora: (thoughts) Take your time, Trace. I can wait.Narration: Third week‚Ä¶
Eric: Hurry up, you idiots! The storm‚Äôs upon us. Take everything down, now!
Trace: Flora, maybe you should keep resting‚Äî
Flora: I rested all yesterday. My stomach stopped hurting hours ago.
Flora: It was probably just all that food‚Äî
Keith: Hey, guys. Have you seen Natani around lately?
Flora: Oh yeah, I think he‚Äôs sick or something. He locked himself in his room two days ago.
Flora: He asked me to bring down some food for him.
Flora: He didn‚Äôt open the door, though.
Flora: Just told me to leave it there.
Flora: It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve gotten him any more, though.
Keith: Eh, I guess I‚Äôll get it for‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ him.Keith: (thoughts) Feh, what am I, a butler?
Keith: Hey Natani, are you alright? I brought you some dinner‚Ä¶
Natani: Keith? Ah‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt come in! Just‚Ä¶ ‚Äîhuff‚Äî leave it by the door. I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm ill! Please, go away. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ contagious!
Keith: Don‚Äôt be ridiculous. We Basitin don‚Äôt get sick, I‚Äôm not in danger of catching anything.
Keith: I‚Äôm coming in‚Ä¶
Natani: What?! No..!
Natani: (thoughts) Ah! My lock spell failed! I couldn‚Äôt concentrate‚Ä¶ Grah, why do all Eric‚Äôs doors come without manual locks?Keith: Uh‚Ä¶ Natani?
Keith: (thoughts) What the‚Äì? There‚Äôs a strong scent in here. Strange, I can‚Äôt tell what it is, though. I swear I recognize it from somewhere‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Thank goodness, it worked. I can mask the scent magically. But I don‚Äôt know how long I can hold it‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) His scent is‚Ä¶ ah, no, don‚Äôt think about it!
Natani: Keith, haven‚Äôt you ever heard of ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù? I told you I don‚Äôt want anyone in my room!
Natani: Why did you barge in here?
Keith: I just wanted to make sure you were okay! Believe it or not, I usually enjoy talking with you. But if you don‚Äôt want my help, then fine, I‚Äôll leave.
Natani: You‚Ä¶ were really concerned about me?
Keith: Well yeah, I guess. Why not?
Natani: I‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm an assassin. Only my brother‚Äôs ever cared about me.Natani: (thoughts) Aw, jeez, now I‚Äôm getting emotional.
Natani: (thoughts) I despise this body‚Ä¶
Keith: Nat, why are you so insistent on dealing with this by yourself?
Natani: Well I‚Ä¶
Natani: I know you‚Äôre just helping me because you know I‚Äôm a girl. You wouldn‚Äôt be so eager if I was still a guy to you.
Keith: Natani, that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm helping you! If Trace was bedridden for two days, I‚Äôd help him too.
Keith: Just because you‚Äôre a ‚Äúguy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt accept help.
Keith: So, are you sure there isn‚Äôt anything I can do to help you?
Natani: Yes, Keith, I know how you can heal me! Come over here and be a miracle-worker!
Natani: Urgh, okay Keith, if you want to help me‚Ä¶ Get me something for my headache.Keith: Now, this won‚Äôt taste very good‚Ä¶
Keith: But it should work quickly.
Natani: (thoughts) Hurry up and then leave, this is torture!
Keith: Hey Nat‚Ä¶?
Natani: Hm?
Keith: Are you wearing some sort of‚Ä¶ perfume?
Natani: What?! Why?
Keith: I dunno‚Ä¶ I keep sensing‚Ä¶ some sort of scent, but I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶can‚Äôt figure it out. You, um‚Ä¶
Natani: Keith, why are you staring at me?
Keith: I, um, I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôll just‚Ä¶ finish making this‚Ä¶
Keith: (thoughts) Jeez, what‚Äôs wrong with me? I‚Äôve never thought of Natani like that‚Ä¶ Why am I getting excited all of the sudden?Keith: Here ya go, it‚Äôs ready.
Natani: Oh, thanks. Um, what does it do, again?
Keith: Well, it should just help you relax. Might make you a little tired, too.
Natani: Bleh! It tastes terrible!
Keith: Heh, told you.
Keith: How do you feel? It should work quickly.
Natani: Eh, I feel a little better I guess. Not by much‚Ä¶
Keith: Ah, well, I guess I should be going now. Take care of yourself, Nat. Call for me if you need‚Äî
Keith: ‚Ä¶Eh? Natani? Hey, you okay?
Natani: Nehm‚Ä¶Keith: Wait‚Ä¶ why didn‚Äôt I recognize it before! Natani, you‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre‚Äî
Natani: Mmhm‚Ä¶.
Natani: I‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt want you to know‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want anyone to know‚Ä¶ This problem is‚Ä¶ a weakness‚Ä¶
Natani: I‚Äôve hardly slept at all in the last two days‚Ä¶
Natani: I‚Äôve been so stressed out‚Ä¶ I finally feel relaxed now. Thank you, Keith.
Keith: Um, well, you‚Äôre welcome. I.. uh, I‚Äôd better leave now, I guess.
Keith: (thoughts) Before I do something I‚Äôll regret‚Äî ack!
Natani: Keith, wait‚Ä¶
Natani: Keith‚Ä¶ please, can‚Äôt you‚Ä¶ stay with me tonight?
Keith: Natani‚Ä¶! I, uh‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think that would be a good idea!Natani: I didn‚Äôt mean it like that‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want you to‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶
Natani: I just don‚Äôt like‚Ä¶ feeling vulnerable.
Natani: Erg‚Ä¶
Natani: I just want to relax‚Ä¶
Keith: Well‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it would be a good idea for me to stay in here. But, uh, if you want‚Ä¶ I can stand outside your door for you, I guess.
Natani: Neh‚Ä¶
Natani: Yes‚Ä¶
Natani: That‚Ä¶ that would be‚Ä¶ nice‚Ä¶.
Keith: (thoughts) Huh, she‚Äôs really out of it‚Ä¶ I wonder if she‚Äôd be mad if I did stay‚Ä¶?
Keith: (thoughts) Erg, no, I can‚Äôt think that way! I gotta get out of here‚Ä¶
Keith: Sleep well, Natani.Trace: The storm‚Äôs getting rough. Will it slow us down?
Eric: Only a little. But we‚Äôve made good time.
Eric: Winds have been at our back for most of the trip.e
Trace: Ah, that‚Äôs good‚Ä¶ Hey, Eric, I have a question for you.
Eric: Ask away.
Trace: You know that Flora and I are a couple, right? Is that.. strange?
Eric: Hah, I think you‚Äôre asking the wrong guy. You know that I have a certain affinity for Keidran.
Eric: But yes, it‚Äôs rather unusual to find someone who appreciates Keidran in the way I do.
Trace: But, I don‚Äôt! It‚Äôs just Flora I care about.
Eric: You mean like, a serious relationship? I‚Äôve never heard of such a thing working out.
Trace: What? Why?
Eric: Well, don‚Äôt you know about their life span?
Eric: Keidran only live to be about 20 years old. By the time you‚Äôre in your late 30‚Äôs, she‚Äôll probably be close to the end of her life.[Ornaments Fragile]Trace: 20 years?! Is that all? Flora said it was short, but‚Ä¶
Trace: 20 years is hardly anything at all!
Eric: Well, it seems short to us.
Eric: Keidran tend to think we humans live unnaturally long.
Trace: But‚Ä¶ there must be something I can do! Some kind of spell, or potion, or‚Äî
Eric: I‚Äôm afraid not, Trace. Many wizards have wasted their entire lives trying to find a way to work around their mortality. Magic can do many things, but even it has its limits. Some Keidran can make it to late-20‚Äôs, if they‚Äôre lucky, but‚Ä¶
Eric: I think you should enjoy the time you have with Flora.
Eric: There‚Äôs no point in worrying about something you can‚Äôt possibly change.
Trace: Don‚Äôt tell me what I can and can‚Äôt do.
Trace: (thoughts) I have the power to do what I want. Flora won‚Äôt die if I have anything to say about it.Flora: (thoughts) I hope this storm doesn‚Äôt slow us down. I‚Äôm getting sick of this boat.
Flora: (thoughts) Hm, I‚Äôve never been down here‚Ä¶ oh, no, it‚Äôs the hussy again.
Kat: Oh! Hi, Flora! What‚Äôs up?
Flora: (thoughts) Look at her, acting all innocent. I wonder what she‚Äôs really thinking‚Ä¶
Kat: (thoughts) Oh, hey, it‚Äôs Flora! Hi, Flora!
Kat: (thoughts) I wonder what‚Äôs up with her?
Flora: What are you up to? Is that a human book?
Kat: Oh, yeah, I was just practicing my reading. If you want to read, feel free to take any book you like off the shelf. Eric won‚Äôt mind.
Flora: Well, um, actually‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt read‚Ä¶ it was illegal when I was a slave to learn how.Kat: You can‚Äôt read? That‚Äôs not good! I thought Mr. Trace seemed nice‚Ä¶
Flora: Oh, no, it wasn‚Äôt Trace. It was my‚Ä¶ former owners who didn‚Äôt teach me.
Kat: Ah, I know what you mean!
Kat: I used to be owned by Master Eric‚Äôs brother. He never let me learn anything, but Eric saved me from that place!
Flora: (thoughts) Huh, that must be why she likes Eric so much‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶yeesh‚Ä¶ I wonder if Kat has back problems‚Ä¶
Kat: Anyway, I can‚Äôt read well, but I can show you what I know‚Ä¶ I usually read the ones with pictures, they‚Äôre easier.
Flora: Wait, pictures? Let me see this‚Ä¶
Flora: What the-? This book is just filled with perverted Keidran artwork! Grah! Eric, you perv!!Flora: Hi, Keith, how‚Äôs Natani?
Keith: Oh, hi, Flora. He‚Äôs fine, just resting.
Flora: That‚Äôs good.
Flora: I‚Äôm going to give Eric a piece of my mi‚Äî
Flora: ‚Ä¶that‚Äôs strange‚Ä¶
Keith: S-something wrong, Flora?
Flora: Uh, no, no‚Ä¶ nothing wrong.
Flora: (thoughts) I thought I smelled‚Ä¶ no, I must be imagining things‚Ä¶
Mike: Ugh, this storm isn‚Äôt letting up.
Mike: Thank the gods for breaks.
Mike: (thoughts) Ye gods! It‚Äôs that Basitin again!
Keith: (thoughts) What now‚Ä¶?
Mike: Wait‚Ä¶ that scent on you‚Ä¶ a wolf in‚Ä¶
Mike: Aaaah! W-what have you done to that poor guy now?!
Mike: Aiiieeeee!!
Keith: Wait, stop, I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ oh, great.Narration: Later‚Ä¶
Keith: R-r-r-reh‚Ä¶
Keith: Jeez that water‚Äôs cold.
Keith: (thoughts) At least I‚Äôve finally gotten Natani‚Äôs scent out of my fur. ‚Ä¶and stopped being perpetually excited‚Ä¶
Eric: Kat, bring the iodine‚Äî Oh, sorry, Keith.
Keith: It‚Äôs alright, I was leaving‚Ä¶. what happened to you?
Eric: Honestly I‚Äôm not sure.
Eric: One minute I‚Äôm drinking tea, the next Flora‚Äôs telling me not to corrupt Kathrin. Then I reassure her with a harmless pat on the rear, and‚Ä¶ this happened.
Eric: Oh, while you‚Äôre here‚Ä¶
Eric: I‚Äôve heard word that you know some‚Ä¶ Basitin magic‚Ä¶?
Eric: If it‚Äôs true‚Ä¶
Eric: Hey, wait‚Ä¶ where are ya going? Change Mike! I need a new fox girl!Flora: Trace, check out my new pj‚Äôs!
Trace: Oh, yeah, they‚Äôre nice‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace, you didn‚Äôt look! ‚Ä¶Aren‚Äôt you coming to bed?
Trace: No, I need to finish this first. You go ahead.
Flora: Aw, come on, Trace, come to bed. I‚Äôll even give you the honor of giving me a foot massage!
Trace: Heh, funny. Well as tempting as that offer is‚Ä¶ Seriously, I‚Äôve got a lot more work to do.
Trace: I‚Äôm gunna be at least another hour‚Ä¶
Flora: Oh, okay‚Ä¶
Flora: Well‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôll go to sleep, then‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Trace, you idiot‚Ä¶Trace: (thoughts) Bah, I just don‚Äôt understand enough of this magic‚Ä¶ I need to remember‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Why?
Trace: (thoughts) Why? Because if I don‚Äôt, Flora will die in only a few years‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Is that all?
Trace: (thoughts) Well‚Ä¶ part of me really wants to know more about my past, too.
Nora: (thoughts) Look at what you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôre fighting to extend Flora‚Äôs life, so you can spend more time with her later.
Nora: (thoughts) Yet by working too much, you‚Äôre wasting the time you have with her now.
Nora: (thoughts) The future is never certain. Enjoy the time you have at present.
Trace: Sigh‚Ä¶
Flora: Hm? Oh, change your mind, Trace?
Trace: Yeah, I guess I‚Ä¶ talked myself out of the work.
Nora: (thoughts) Mrr, that was easy. Now the entertainment begins‚Ä¶ ah, to be young and full of energy‚Ä¶Wolf: Natani‚Ä¶ Natani‚Ä¶
Natani: Zen‚Ä¶?
Natani: You‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not Zen.
Wolf: No, I‚Äôm not your brother. I am speaking through him on behalf of your king.
Wolf: He‚Äôs been disappointed in your failures. You have yet to kill your targets‚Ä¶
Natani: Zen should have told you weeks ago I can‚Äôt‚Äî
Wolf: We know. Your objective has changed. We want you to continue following Trace. We believe he is still important to the humans.
Wolf: Don‚Äôt let him get into human hands, but only kill him if you must. He may be useful now that we are at war.
Natani: What, war? How did that happen?
Wolf: That‚Äôs not important. We will inform you further if it is necessary.
Wolf: Until then, do not forget where your true loyalties lie.Narration: 4 days later‚Ä¶
Eric: Land on the horizon!
Eric: Mike, let the others know we‚Äôve spotted the island. We‚Äôll likely locate the harbor by evening.
Eric: And by ‚Äòothers‚Äô I mean all of them, the Basitin included. He‚Äôs been complaining that you‚Äôre all avoiding him.
Mike: Aye, Master‚Ä¶
Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Zen, I‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôm almost over this‚Ä¶ problem. Quit changing the subject on me. What is this war‚Ä¶?
Zen: (thoughts) Relax, little brother. The king knows what he‚Äôs doing. The humans are not as strong as we believed.
Zen: (thoughts) Five days ago, their king was assassinated.
Natani: (in Keidran) Assassinated by our tribe? Is he crazy?! We can‚Äôt hope to fight the humans by ourselves!
Zen: (in Keidran) Natani, Natani, you overestimate the human‚Äôs power. Assassinating their king was apparently easy.
Zen: (in Keidran) And without a king to control them, the Templar cannot hope to function.Natani: Oh, Keith, I wanted to thank you for‚Ä¶ ya know, helping me out.
Keith: Eh, no problem.
Natani: Look‚Ä¶ uh, I know I may have said some things these last few days that‚Ä¶
Natani: ‚Ä¶that I really didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶
Narration: Two days prior‚Ä¶
Natani: Keeeeith! Please, I need you‚Ä¶
Natani: I can‚Äôt take it anymore, I‚Äôll do anything you want! Keith..!
Keith: Don‚Äôt worry, I know you weren‚Äôt yourself. Instinct gets the best of us all.
Keith: You‚Äôre just lucky no one heard you. And I‚Äôm just glad I never have to do guard duty again.
Natani: Um, actually‚Ä¶ I really need a bath, and I was hoping‚Ä¶
Keith: Alright, alright. One last time, but that‚Äôs it! I‚Äôm not your personal bodyguard.Natani: (in Keidran) Alright, make sure no one comes in here. And that means you, too!
Keith: (in Keidran) Yeah, yeah, I get it. Relax, no one‚Äôs going to get by me. Just don‚Äôt take too long.
Keith: Sigh‚Ä¶
Nickolai: Interesting‚Ä¶
Basitin Soldier: What is it, sir?
Nickolai: A human ship is approaching‚Ä¶ a rare sight these days. Hrm, and yet I sense a familiar presence.
Nickolai: Hah! What‚Äôs this? It couldn‚Äôt be‚Ä¶
Basitin Soldier: Sir‚Ä¶?
Nickolai: Forget it. Inform the king that we have guests. And allow the ship to dock at the harbor.
Basitin Soldier: Right away, general!
Nickolai: Hmhm‚Ä¶ Welcome home, my friend.Eric: It‚Äôs out here, Kathrin. I want you to see this.
Kat: Come on, can‚Äôt you tell me? What do you want me to see?
Eric: Just look‚Ä¶
Kat: Woah‚Ä¶!Natani: (in Keidran) Keith, could you get me some clothes?
Keith: (in Keidran) Eh? What happened to the clothes you were wearing?
Natani: (in Keidran) I couldn‚Äôt get my scent out of them! Look, just get me something, quick!
Keith: (in Keidran) Alright, alright, jeez‚Ä¶
Trace: Hey, Keith. What‚Äôs up?
Keith: Oh, Trace! Um, the wash room is‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ occupied.
Trace: That‚Äôs okay. I was headed upstairs. I wanted to have a look at your island.
Keith: Oh, yeah. That reminds me‚Ä¶
Keith: Trace, I‚Äôve kinda avoided bringing this up for a while. You know I consider you my friend, right? I would never willingly go against you. But‚Ä¶ if I‚Äôm ordered‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs between you and my people, I might have to‚Ä¶
Trace: I understand, Keith. Let‚Äôs just hope it doesn‚Äôt come to that.Natani: (thoughts) The air is cool today. The cold season is coming soon.
Natani: (thoughts) Fah! I hope I‚Äôm out of here before my winter coat comes in. It‚Äôll be even harder to conceal these stupid things when I get poofy.
Natani: (thoughts) Hurry up, Keith! I hate being naked‚Ä¶
Narration: ‚ÄúMeanwhile‚Ä¶‚Äù
Mike: Uh‚Ä¶ Keith, sir? Hello, are you in there?
Mike: Keith‚Ä¶?
Keith: Hey, I‚Äôm over here. What do you want?
Mike: O-oh! Uh‚Ä¶ Master wants me to t-tell you we‚Äôre at the island. He wants your help on deck.
Keith: Alright, tell him I‚Äôll be there in a minute.
Mike: Wait‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt that the wolf guy‚Äôs cabin? What‚Äôs Keith doing with his clothes‚Ä¶
Mike: And‚Ä¶ strips of cloth? ‚Ä¶For tying him up?! Oh gods!Flora: Nya~ah!
Flora: (thoughts) It‚Äôs light out already! Trace must have let me sleep in again.
Flora: (thoughts) I wonder where he went‚Ä¶
Flora: Eh-?
Flora: (thoughts) Maybe I have been eating a lot lately.
Flora: (thoughts) Strange, usually it‚Äôs really hard for people of my tribe to gain weight.
Flora: (thoughts) Which is why those who are well fed are considered more attractive‚Ä¶
Flora: (thoughts) But for some reason humans are backwards. I guess I should be more careful with what I eat, for Trace.Flora: (thoughts) I hope someone left out some hot water. A nice soak would really hit the spot.
Keith: Wait‚Äî!
Flora: Oh, Keith! You startled me!
Keith: Sorry, Flora. Listen, you can‚Äôt go in there‚Ä¶
Keith: I‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ have to wash these clothes‚Ä¶
Flora: Oh, well, why can‚Äôt we go in together? I don‚Äôt mind if you watch me bathe.
Flora: Maybe you could even give me a hand‚Ä¶
Keith: Ah‚Ä¶! Well, I‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt think that would be a good idea.
Keith: Just‚Ä¶ come back in a few minutes, please.
Keith: Damn Keidran‚Ä¶ Why am I always being tempted by that which I cannot have?Natani: (thoughts) I don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt just cut my hair off completely. Just adds to the trouble of getting dry.
Keith: Phew! This is the last time I‚Äôm anyone‚Äôs personal servant.
Keith: Sorry, Natani! I had to come in.
Keith: Flora thinks‚Äî ah‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶
Keith: I‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶
Natani: Keith! What are you doing in here?!Natani: Why did you come in here?! I told you to wait outside! And‚Ä¶ stop looking at me!
Keith: Er, sorry.
Keith: Look, it wasn‚Äôt my fault. I told Flora I was washing clothes‚Ä¶ So she wouldn‚Äôt come in here.
Keith: I‚Äôll just set your clothes down here and look away.
Keith: I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre making such a big deal. I saw you naked last time.
Natani: Yeah, well, I‚Äôd rather not make a habit of it! I don‚Äôt want people to see me like this‚Äî
Natani: Especially you!
Keith: It‚Äôs your own fault! You shouldn‚Äôt have been bent over like that‚Ä¶
Keith: With‚Ä¶ with your tail up‚Ä¶ as if you were‚Ä¶ offering yourself‚Äî
Natani: Stop fantasizing about my body!
Keith: I-I‚Äôm not!Keith: ‚Ä¶
Natani: ‚Ä¶
Natani: Alright, I‚Äôm covered.
Natani: You can look now‚Ä¶ Er‚Ä¶ I mean, if you want to‚Ä¶
Natani: What do you think? Pretty good, hm?
Keith: Uh‚Ä¶ sure, you look quite manly‚Ä¶ Your scent still gives it away, though.
Natani: Oh, yeah, I know. I just need to use my spells again.
Natani: As an assassin, I have many spells to disguise my scent.
Keith: Oh, right‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why no one‚Äôs noticed before.
Keith: ‚Ä¶You‚Äôve been an assassin a long time, haven‚Äôt you?
Natani: Oh‚Ä¶ yeah, I joined the Brotherhood after Zen did. But I‚Äôd rather not talk about it‚Ä¶Zen: I‚Äôm tired of having to live out here in the forest outside town. I‚Äôm tired of having to steal and beg for food every day.
Zen: Once I get into the Brotherhood we‚Äôll finally be able to get a good meal.
Young Natani: Brother, wait! Please, take me with you!
Zen: I told you before, Natani, you can‚Äôt.
Zen: Even if I was willing to let you, they don‚Äôt allow girls. Now get up.
Zen: You‚Äôre my only sister, Natani.
Zen: You‚Äôre all I‚Äôve got left, now.
Zen: Natani‚Ä¶?
Zen: Natani! What have you done to your hair?
Young Natani: I‚Äôll grow it back once I‚Äôm in‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not your little sister anymore.
Zen: Natani, you don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôll do to you.
Eric: (in Human) We‚Äôve reached land! Everyone get ready! Please meet above deck.
Keith: Natani, he said we need to get on deck. You ready?
Natani: Huh? Oh, right. Yes.Kat: It‚Äôs so nice to finally get off that ship!
Eric: Hey, watch your step, now. Here, let me help you, my dear‚Ä¶
Flora: Wow! Look at all the‚Ä¶ Keiths! There are Keiths‚Ä¶ everywhere!
Keith: Hey, what‚Äôs that supposed to mean?
Flora: I‚Ä¶ uh, sorry. You all do kinda look alike‚Ä¶
Keith: That‚Äôs not true! I don‚Äôt look like any of them!
Eric: Uh, guys‚Ä¶ heads up. This doesn‚Äôt look good‚Ä¶
Eric: What have we done to warrant the attention of all three Basitin generals?Trace: You know them?
Eric: Not really, but I‚Äôve heard about them.
Eric: Let me see if I can recall‚Ä¶
Eric: Ah, yes‚Ä¶ I remember.
Eric: The one on the left is the intelligence general, I believe. He‚Äôs a veteran of the military.
Eric: He‚Äôs been around since the Keidran-Human wars. They say his knowledge rivals that of dragons.
Nora: (thoughts) Pfff, right‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been flying since before his ancient ancestors were even born.
Eric: The big guy on the right is the arms general. In brute strength, he‚Äôs the strongest of all the Basitin.
Eric: He‚Äôs a match for even the mightiest of beasts‚Ä¶ such as a dragon.
Nora: (thoughts) I bet I could bite his head off faster than he could blink.
Eric: As for the third‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt recognize him.
Eric: But he must be the current standing master general. He‚Äôs supposed to be a lethal combination of both intelligence and strength.
Eric: The most powerful basitin. Able to take down even‚Ä¶ a dragon.
Nora: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶.. Perhaps this is why my brothers and sisters do not care for lesser beings.Keith: ‚Ä¶You?
Nickolai: Surprised to see me? I‚Äôm surprised, too. I never thought I‚Äôd see your face back here after all these years.
Nickolai: I was sure you‚Äôd be gone for good.
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Nickolai: But now you‚Äôre back. So‚Ä¶
Keith: Grah!
Nickolai: Welcome home, Brother!
Keith: Alaric‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt breathe!General Alabaster: General! Such gross displays of public affection are not at all decent.
General Alabaster: Besides, this one is no brother of ours. He is an outcast, as you‚Äôre well aware.
General Alabaster: Hmph! You come to us with your feet uncovered.
General Alabaster: How indecent‚Ä¶ Have you gone so native as to walk around in the dirt like a common dog?
General Alabaster: Have you no shame? Or have you grown used to living like a Keidran?
Keith: I‚Äôm sorry, General. I didn‚Äôt remember‚Äî
General Alabaster: Don‚Äôt you speak out of turn, Former Keiser! You may have left as a child but you‚Äôre an adult now. You follow adult laws.
General Alabaster: Look at me when I speak to you, boy!
Keith: Augh!
General Alabaster: You always were the runt of the litter. You have brought disgrace to your people and your nation. Why have you returned?Nickolai: That‚Äôs enough, Alabaster. Let the boy explain himself.
Keith: I was banished on the condition that I could return if I brought back Trace.
Keith: I have done so. You should recognize him.
Trace: Flora, get up‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre supposed to be on our best behavior here.
Flora: Nya, my legs are tired‚Ä¶
General Alabaster: That is him‚Ä¶! But‚Ä¶ no, it can‚Äôt be!
General Alabaster: Never in my years has anyone returned from banishment!
General Alabaster: The conditions were supposed to be impossible to accomplish! You were meant to accept your punishment with dignity and die!
General Alabaster: You were not supposed to return!
Nickolai: And yet he has. It‚Äôs out of our hands now, General. We have no choice but to grant little Keith access back into our glorious society.
Nickolai: It is law.Mike: Hey, looks like they‚Äôre letting them into the city.
Evals: Ah, good. No more Basitin on the ship!
Mike: You said it. I can relax a little. That dark Basitin magic is scary.
Mike: It was hard constantly avoiding that guy.
Mike: I‚Äôd hate to end up like that wolf‚Äî ‚Ä¶Huh. I feel strange‚Ä¶
Evals: M-Mike‚Ä¶! Look at yourself!
Mike: Ah!W-what‚Äôs happening to my body?!
Mike: T-that Basitin! He cursed me! Ah! T-this feels really weird! What am I going to do?
Evals: Woah‚Ä¶ Mike, you look‚Ä¶ hot‚Ä¶
Mike: What?!
Nora: (thoughts) Mrahaha! Well, I‚Äôm starving. I haven‚Äôt eaten in weeks.
Nora: (thoughts) I‚Äôll undo the illusion later, if they can‚Äôt.Flora: Everyone‚Äôs looking at us.
Keith: You guys do kinda stick out.
Flora: Hey Trace‚Ä¶
Flora: Have you noticed anything‚Ä¶ strange about the women here?
Flora: Seems like every other woman we pass by is‚Ä¶ well, pregnant.
Eric: You‚Äôre right, Flora. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt tend to visit the islands this time of year.
Flora: I don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶
Keith: Flora, Basitins‚Ä¶ um, we‚Ä¶ only mate once per year. At the same time.
Flora: What?! Why?
Keith: Well, all females live together on the inside of our city. While all the males live outside the city. Living together, all our females have their cycles at the same time once per year.
Keith: So we have one week set aside for‚Ä¶ reproduction. Outside that, it is not permitted.
Flora: That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ horrible‚Ä¶
Keith: It‚Äôs not! It‚Äôs efficient and organized. And law.Nickolai: You will stay here in this tavern.
Nickolai: You and your friends may feel free to look around and buy supplies. But do not leave this district, and respect the curfew.
Nickolai: Keith, you may be one of us again, but you are not yet free. You will be summoned soon to stand trial. Prepare yourself, my friend.
Nickolai: You, human. Are you not Eric, the slave trader?
Eric: Why, yes, I am.
Nickolai: Are those Keidran your slaves?
Eric: Well‚Ä¶ the spotted one is mine. The tiger is Trace‚Äôs, and the wolf is his own.
Nickolai: Very well. We tolerate keidran, but we ask you keep them under control.
General Alabaster: Yes, most certainly.
General Alabaster: We may tolerate their kind, but we do not tolerate their promiscuous ways. And make sure their feet are covered next time they‚Äôre out. Public nudity is unlawful.
Nickolai: We leave you now, Keith. Good luck.
Sirus (Basitin): Ah, customers!
Sirus (Basitin): Welcome, welcome. I‚Äôve been expecting you.Flora: Keith, why do I have to wear these silly things?
Keith: Sorry, Flora. The feet, ankles, the base of the tail and between the legs are what we consider nudity here.
Eric: Hey, guys.
Eric: Everyone‚Äôs signed in now. Go ahead and stretch your legs or relax. We‚Äôve got three rooms to ourselves upstairs.
Keith: Three rooms! But‚Ä¶ we need at least four!
Eric: Sorry, Keith. That guy said they only had three.
Eric: Here are the keys. Looks like you‚Äôll be sharing a room with Natani again.
Keith: Aw, man‚Ä¶ Not again.
Natani: (in Keidran) What? What‚Äôs wrong? I can‚Äôt understand a word anyone is saying!Eric: Alright, I‚Äôm going back to the ship to get some supplies.
Eric: We‚Äôll all meet back here at dusk, alright?
Flora: Okay, let‚Äôs look around, Trace!
Trace: What do you want to look for?
Flora: Food! Good food!
Flora: I‚Äôm sick and tired of the ship‚Äôs meals! I want fresh meat! Still bleeding! Mmm‚Ä¶
Trace: Heh, well that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ disturbing. But if it‚Äôs what you want, okay.
Keith: I‚Äôm going to walk around too.
Natani: (in Keidran) H-hey, wait! Where is everyone going?
Natani: (in Keidran) Oh, forget you guys. I‚Äôll just stay here. I‚Äôll be fine on my own.
Natani: (in Keidran) Here, in this‚Ä¶ strange town‚Ä¶ surrounded by strange people‚Ä¶ Everyone speaking in a language I can‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶ No forests in sight‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) Keith!
Natani: (in Keidran) Don‚Äôt leave me here alone!Flora: Look, Trace. I think we can get something here!
Trace: Yeah, I guess so. Wait up, Flora. Hope they can understand us‚Ä¶
Butcher: Well, if it ain‚Äôt a little human an‚Äô a Keidran missus. What can I do for ya?
Trace: Well, uh, how much is‚Ä¶ um, what do you have?
Flora: smells so good‚Ä¶
Butcher: Well, that depends, whacha got, honey?
Trace: Uh, how much‚Ä¶
Trace: ‚Ä¶ can I get for this?
Butcher: (thoughts) What‚Äôs this, more human money? Wait, this is a real gold piece!
Butcher: (thoughts) Not broken up or nuthin‚Äô‚Ä¶
Butcher: (in Basitin) Roran, put a cow on the fire!
Butcher: (in Basitin) We got some hungry customers!Evals: Come on, Mike! Just let me see!
Mike: Evals, stop! I‚Äôm still a guy! Get your hands off me!
Evals: Oh, you‚Äôre no fun. If it was me‚Äî
Evals: ‚Ä¶Hm? Uh, oh‚Ä¶!
Evals: Mike! Incoming!
Evals: Master Eric and Miss Kathrin are coming back!
Mike: What? Already?! Oh no! What am I going to do?
Evals: Oh, I know! Quick!
Evals: Let‚Äôs barricade ourselves in my room!
Mike: ‚Ä¶..
Evals: Or yours, I‚Äôm fine with that too.
Mike: Nya‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm doomed‚Ä¶
Mike: Did I just say ‚Äúnya‚Äù?Natani: (thoughts) I feel‚Ä¶ tall‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) I thought it was just Keith, but‚Ä¶ these people are short! And I‚Äôm only 18 palms high.
Natani: (in Keidran) Hey, where are we headed?
Keith: (in Keidran) ‚Ä¶You‚Äôll see eventually.
Basitin Soldier: Keith Keiser! I would not recommend going any further‚Ä¶
Basitin Soldier: You are advised not to leave the docks.
Keith: I‚Äôm well aware of that, but there is something I must do.
Keith: If you won‚Äôt let me pass, I will challenge you to let me through.
Basitin Soldier: I would not advise you to challenge me, Brother. I heavily outrank you. You‚Äôd have no chance.
Keith: (in Keidran) Natani, get back.
Natani: (in Keidran) Huh? Why?Templar: Why are you concerned? Once our king is out of the way, the Keidran will have‚Äî
Master Seer: We have more to worry about than the Keidran.
Templar: Euchre! Where have you been?
Euchre: Sorry‚Ä¶
Euchre: I had to attend to a personal matter. Please continue.
Master Seer: As I was saying‚Ä¶
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: mew?
Master Seer: The Basitin are who we should be concerned about. They may not be our enemy now, but who knows who those beasts will side with when war breaks out. We cannot afford to fight on two fronts. Especially with a race like the Basitin.
Trace: I already told you all only to worry about the Keidran. I have already taken care of the Basitin.
Trace: I have a man on the island‚Ä¶ True, we couldn‚Äôt hope to defeat them directly. We must first rot them from the inside‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace, are you okay?
Trace: Huh? Oh, yeah. I just‚Ä¶ I feel like I‚Äôve been here before‚Ä¶Natani: What‚Äôs going on? Why are you fighting? Should I be fighting, too?
Madelyn: Relax, this is normal.
Natani: Oh‚Ä¶ huh? You can speak Keidran?
Madelyn: Yes, some. Just enjoy fight. Happens often.Keith: (thoughts) Not good‚Ä¶
Keith: (thoughts) This guy is stronger than I am and his reach is longer. But I‚Äôm probably faster‚Ä¶ just need to get under that glaive‚Ä¶!
Keith: Grrr‚Ä¶
Keith: Graah!
Keith: A sword!
Basitin Soldier: You‚Äôre giving away your intentions.Keith: (thoughts) There‚Äôs no way for me to win fighting as I am now.
Keith: (thoughts) My fighting style‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre both using the Basitin Standard. He knows it better than I do.
Keith: (thoughts) But the only other fighting style I know is‚Ä¶ Wolven Style. It‚Äôs inferior, but it may just throw him off.
Keith: (thoughts) I don‚Äôt have much of a choice.
Keith: Here goes! Grr-ahh!
Basitin Soldier: Arms wide open?
Basitin Soldier: Brother, you‚Äôre becoming‚Ä¶
Basitin Soldier: slopp‚Äî eh?Basitin Soldier: You are better than I had thought. Your rank masks your skill.
Basitin Soldier: I concede to you, Brother.
Basitin Soldier: I will not stop you from crossing this bridge. But I still would not recommend it.
Keith: I will take responsibility for my actions here.
Madelyn: Oh, my. Your friend is quite‚Ä¶ amazing‚Ä¶
Natani: Oookay‚Ä¶ This girl‚Äôs getting a little too excited from watching them fight.
Keith: We can go now, Natani.
Natani: Right behind you!
Natani: So, Keith‚Ä¶ That last move‚Ä¶
Keith: Oh, you noticed? I learned that from you when we practiced sword fighting on the ship.
Natani: Learned from me? ‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt think you would care how I fought.
Keith: Well of course I would. You have a lot of skill. There‚Äôs always something to learn from another good fighter.
Natani: Oh‚Ä¶ I see‚Ä¶Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Knight: General‚Ä¶ Sire, we‚Äôve just received word ‚Äî another village has been attacked by the Wolves.
Knight: Along with several settlements near the borders. It‚Äôs a full-scale invasion.
Knight: The Keidran are killing indiscriminately; men, women and children alike.
General: ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt understand. First our King and now this‚Ä¶ why would they attack us?
Knight: Does there need to be a reason? They‚Äôre animals, it was bound to happen.
General: I have no love for those beasts, but I never thought they would go as far as this‚Ä¶
Knight: The Templar have offered their support in the fight‚Äî
General: The Templar? Those damn magic-users probably caused this mess.
Knight: Sire, with all due respect‚Ä¶ The Templar are loyal protectors of our country.
Knight: They would never dare cause such a coup against their own empire.
General: The Templar are greedy and corrupt. I can‚Äôt help but feel that somehow they are responsible for this.
General: Have the servants ready my horse. Perhaps‚Ä¶ I will try to speak some reason before this gets out of hand.Mike: Please, you can‚Äôt let Eric find me!
Evals: You want me to lie to our master
Mike: Yes, please‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll do anything!
Evals: Anything? How about a‚Ä¶ striptease‚Ä¶?
Mike: S-s-strip?? You want me to see me‚Ä¶ naked‚Ä¶ ?!
Evals: I think I hear Eric coming‚Ä¶
Mike: O-okay! Fine! Just stop him!
Eric: There you are! Where‚Äôs Mike? I need you two to carry my supplies.
Evals: Oh! Hello, Master! Mike? He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ um, sick! He caught that bug the wolf guy had a few days ago.
Eric: Ah, that‚Äôs too bad.
Eric: I guess you‚Äôll have to do it, then.
Evals: Me? Oh, no‚Ä¶ Mike‚Äôs‚Ä¶ really sick. I think I should stay here and help.
Eric: Nonsense! I can‚Äôt have both my best men under the weather, can I?
Eric: Now get going! Make sure to bring my painting supplies as well, I‚Äôll need those.
Evals: Ah, great. I guess I‚Äôll have to wait till later‚Ä¶
Mike: Oh, thank goodness!Natani: Ah‚Ä¶! Wait!
Keith: What‚Äôs wrong?
Natani: This‚Ä¶ this is a graveyard, isn‚Äôt it?
Keith: Yeah, so‚Ä¶?
Natani: We Keidran do not have‚Ä¶ ‚Äúgraveyards‚Äù‚Ä¶ We burn our dead‚Ä¶ and scatter the ashes and remains in the forests.
Natani: Keeping your dead together in boxes, as if‚Ä¶ on display‚Ä¶ You delay their return to the earth‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs h-horrible!
Keith: Look, Natani. I didn‚Äôt ask you to come along. If you‚Äôre afraid, you can stay out here or go back, it doesn‚Äôt matter to me.
Natani: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not afraid! It‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just rows of dead bodies‚Ä¶ under the ground‚Ä¶ w-what‚Äôs to be afraid of?Flora: (in Human) Aaah~! So good!
Trace: (in Human) Eheheh‚Ä¶ Flora‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve got a little‚Ä¶
Flora: Hm?
Trace: (in Human) Eh, nevermind.
Trace: (thoughts) How can she act so innocent while covered in blood?
Butcher: Hey, Roran.
Roran: What is it?
Butcher: Look here, what‚Äôs this coin say?
Roran: It says‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúProvince of Vigil‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúTreasury of the Templar.‚Äù
Butcher: Templar, huh?
Roran: Now, don‚Äôt be gettin‚Äô all suspicious again. I‚Äôm sure plenty o‚Äô humans have these.
Trace: (thoughts) That guy in the forest was right‚Ä¶ she really is vicious!
Butcher: Well, Ah can‚Äôt help it‚Ä¶
Butcher: This ain‚Äôt ta usual coin, an‚Äô I‚Äôve seen five ah these this season.
Roran: Maybe the Templar took over all human coin makin‚Äô. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. They‚Äôve taken over just about everything else.Natani: So‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs your father, huh? I can see the family resemblance‚Ä¶ I think.
Natani: Why does he get his own statue? Was he someone of importance?
Keith: You could say that‚Ä¶
Keith: You remember the Basitin generals? My father was once the arms general.
Keith: But I didn‚Äôt come here to see him. I only came to pay respects to my mother.
Keith: I couldn‚Äôt care any less about him.
Natani: How can you say that? What did your father do to make you hate him?
Keith: ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt like to think about it. It was what got me banished years ago‚Ä¶ My father‚Ä¶ was a great general‚Ä¶
Keith: But he was a terrible person.Natani: You said once that you were blamed for your parents‚Äô deaths. But‚Ä¶ that wasn‚Äôt true, was it? You didn‚Äôt really‚Äî?
Keith: It is the truth‚Ä¶ Well, at least partly.
Keith: I could never have harmed my mother.
Keith: She was unusual for a Basitin‚Ä¶ She sheltered me from fighting and battle.
Keith: She loved my father greatly, though I don‚Äôt know why. He furious disapproved of the way she treated me.
Keith: My father always seemed to hate me‚Ä¶ for being weak and uninterested in fighting‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ I had never thought he hated her.
Keith: I eventually did go off to military training, just as every Basitin does. I came home one day to find that my mother was dead.
Keith: My father had killed her, beaten her to death. If he hadn‚Äôt been so intoxicated, he may of killed me as well‚Ä¶ As he was, he practically fell on my spear‚Ä¶
Keith: But‚Ä¶ that was a long time ago. I was not allowed to pay my respects to my mother, back then.
Keith: Just give me a few moments.Mike: I‚Äôm all alone now. What am I gunna do‚Äî
Mike: Ah! Is‚Ä¶ this what I really look like‚Ä¶?
Mike: M-might as well have a peek‚Ä¶
Mike: Wow! It‚Äôs true! I really am a girl!
Mike: They feel real. What if I‚Äôm stuck like this for the rest of my life?! I‚Äôm a sailor, I don‚Äôt know how to be a girl!
Mike: And if Eric finds out‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm doomed! Oh, I hope that Basitin comes back!
Mike: Evals was right, though‚Ä¶ I guess I do look good. I guess I can‚Äôt blame him. If the situation were reversed, I‚Äôd probably‚Ä¶
Mike: Ah! I‚Äôm attracted to my own reflection! I‚Äôm as bad as Evals!
Mike: No‚Ä¶ I should just put my shirt back on and find a belt before‚Äî
Mike: My‚Ä¶ pants fall off‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶So that‚Äôs what I look like naked.Keith: (in Keidran) Alright, Natani. I‚Äôm ready to leave.
Natani: (in Keidran) Are you sure? I don‚Äôt mind waiting.
Keith: (in Keidran) It‚Äôs okay, I actually‚Ä¶ feel better now. I‚Äôve finally gotten it off my chest.
Lynn: Excuse me.
Lynn: Are you Keith Keiser? I am. Lynn, messenger for Master General.
Keith: How did you know I would be here?
Lynn: When. The general heard you had left the docks, this is where he. Said you‚Äôd be.
Lynn: Here is the message: There is a girl who came to the islands looking for you some time ago. She‚Äôs still here.
Keith: A‚Ä¶ a girl? Who?
Lynn: I don‚Äôt. Know. General has also invited you to join him in the baths. He may. Tell you more. Have. A nice day.Natani: Public baths, huh? I‚Äôm surprised. You Basitin always seem very‚Ä¶ prudish.
Keith: We are‚Ä¶ but, like all the races, not everyone can afford to have an in-home bath. You can get a private bath drawn, however, for a couple extra coins.
Natani: Oh, good‚Äî hey! Why‚Äôd you close the gate on me?
Keith: I‚Äôm sorry, Natani, I can‚Äôt let you in here.
Keith: These are the men‚Äôs baths. By the law, women are not allowed to step beyond the gate. I know you don‚Äôt consider yourself one, but‚Ä¶ physically you are.
Keith: Law forces me to keep you out. I‚Äôm really sorry, Natani‚Ä¶
Natani: That‚Äôs not fair! What am I supposed to do?
Natani: I can‚Äôt go into the women‚Äôs baths!
Keith: Hey, don‚Äôt bare your teeth at me! I said I was sorry. I‚Äôll be out later, just go back to the tavern‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Grrrrr‚Ä¶ Curse that‚Ä¶ Basitin‚Ä¶ and curse this body of mine!Nickolai: Ah, there you are, Keith! I was wondering if you‚Äôd show up! Welcome to my private bath!
Keith: Well, I didn‚Äôt have much of a choice. It‚Äôs the only way I could find out more about the ‚Äúgirl.‚Äù
Keith: And since you‚Äôre the big general now‚Ä¶ I have to do what you say, right?
Nickolai: Oh, don‚Äôt be like that! I didn‚Äôt order you to join me. I just thought we could catch up.
Nickolai: It‚Äôs been almost six years‚Ä¶ no time for your old pal anymore?
Keith: Oh, alright. Enough with the guilt trip, already.
Keith: Some things never change‚Ä¶ except‚Ä¶ that eye of yours‚Ä¶ What happened to your eye, anyway?
Nickolai: Oh, isn‚Äôt it great? But no, you first. Tell me your story and I‚Äôll tell you what you want to know. And please don‚Äôt call me ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still the same Alaric from when we were kids.Flora: ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs amazing, isn‚Äôt it?
Trace: What‚Äôs that, Flora?
Flora: These mountains! I‚Äôve never seen anything so huge before! How do you think they were made?
Trace: I‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know. They are quite big.
Flora: I like ‚Äòem.
Flora: Oh, look, there‚Äôs Natani.
Flora: (in Keidran) Hey, Natani!
Natani: (in Keidran) Eh? Oh, hey, you two. All‚Äôs well?
Flora: (in Keidran) Yup! And you‚Ä¶? Where‚Äôs Keith?
Natani: (in Keidran) Feh! Keith‚Ä¶ Why should I care where he is?
Natani: (in Keidran) He wants to hang out with his Basitin friends‚Ä¶ so, fine! I don‚Äôt care what he does! I don‚Äôt need him! I‚Äôm fine being alone!
Trace: Erm‚Ä¶ what was that all about?
Flora: I have no idea‚Ä¶ It almost sounded like Natani was‚Ä¶ jealous‚Ä¶Trace: Flora, we shouldn‚Äôt be out this far.
Flora: Relax, Trace! The docks are right over there. I like being out in the open.
Flora: It reminds me of‚Ä¶ my old home‚Ä¶
Flora: Is it strange for me to have fond memories from my time as a slave‚Äî Mew‚Ä¶?
Trace: Erm‚Ä¶ well, I don‚Äôt know, Flora‚Ä¶
Flora: Ah‚Ä¶
Dragonfly: !
Trace: Flora! Don‚Äôt eat the dragonfly!
Trace: (thoughts) Ah, jeez, that girl‚Äôs acting more and more like an animal every day.
Trace: (thoughts) Or‚Ä¶ perhaps I‚Äôm just starting to notice more. Maybe I‚Äôm thinking more like a human.
Trace: (thoughts) Oh, I‚Äôll let her have her fun. She deserves it.Narration: One story later‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶And after that, I ended up here.
Nickolai: Wow‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs incredible!
Nickolai: From keidran to human territories‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve travelled nearly the whole world! I‚Äôm envious!
Keith: Yeah, well‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt as fun as it sounds. Now can you tell me who she is already?
Nickolai: Sure, sure‚Ä¶
Nickolai: But don‚Äôt you want to hear about my eye, first?
Nickolai: Aw, fine‚Ä¶
Nickolai: I guess I can tell you later‚Ä¶
Nickolai: Alright, the girl‚Ä¶ You mentioned that you were taken care of by a family of foxes? Interesting‚Ä¶ it was a Keidran of the Fox Tribe who arrived here.
Nickolai: She said she was looking for you. The elders told her you would never return‚Ä¶ But according to her, coming here was her only hope left, since you had gone into human lands.
Nickolai: Now what was here name again‚Ä¶ Lanie? Lorie?
Keith: Laura!
Nickolai: Ah, right, that was it. Who is she?
Keith: She is‚Ä¶ was my fianc√©e.Nickolai: Fianc√©e?! Wow‚Ä¶ I had no idea.
Keith: She‚Äôs still on the island, right? Where is she?!
Nickolai: Relax, Keith. She‚Äôs living in the non-basitin district.
Nickolai: However, you‚Äôll never make it there before curfew.
Nickolai: Tomorrow, I have something to show you at the front castle. Then, I‚Äôll show you where she lives.
Nickolai: Until then, enjoy yourself, Keith‚Ä¶
Keith: Hey!! That‚Äôs highly inappropriate!
Keith: You know I hate it when you do that!
Nickolai: Hah! You still get flustered so easily. You always were the uptight one.
Keith: I‚Äôm not uptight! I just obey the decency laws.
Keith: As you should, too!Keith: (thoughts) ‚ÄúHm‚Ä¶‚Äù
Keith: (thoughts) I honestly never imagined my return to be like this‚Ä¶ I mean, I didn‚Äôt expect parades‚Ä¶
Keith: (thoughts) I half expected to be banished again.
Keith: (thoughts) But life‚Äôs gone on without me‚Ä¶
Keith: (thoughts) I‚Äôd thought that I‚Äôd feel different once I returned home.
Keith: (thoughts) I‚Äôd hate to admit it, but I‚Äôm glad Alaric is here. As big a pain as he can be, it‚Äôs nice to have a friend back.
Nickolai: Hah! I saw that!
Keith: Wha-?
Nickolai: That‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen you smile today!
Nickolai: The Keith I remember‚Ä¶
Nickolai: ‚Ä¶was a playful, scrawny thing of a Basitin. You were always laughing‚Ä¶
Nickolai: I was beginning to think the Basitin I knew was gone for good‚Ä¶ But I can tell you‚Äôre still in there‚Ä¶ under that cynical shell. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre back, Keith.
Keith: I guess I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad to be back, Alaric.Keith: (thoughts) I guess I am home after all‚Ä¶ These islands are where I belong.
Keith: Hey, Natani. What are you doing here?
Natani: Oh, you‚Äôre back‚Ä¶ Well, it isn‚Äôt like I had anywhere else to go‚Äî
Natani: Buh‚Ä¶?
Keith: What?
Natani: You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ smiling! What are you up to?
Keith: Heh, well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just happy for once, I guess.
Keith: I think things are finally looking up for me.
Keith: Anyways, I‚Äôm heading to bed early tonight.
Keith: You‚Äôre welcome to join me, if you‚Äôd like.
Natani: Wha‚Äî?
Natani: (thoughts) That was‚Ä¶ weird. I‚Äôve‚Ä¶ never seen Keith happy before.
Natani: (thoughts) Dang it, now I just can‚Äôt get myself to be mad at him.Basitin Soldier: Trace, Master of the Templars‚Ä¶ It gets dark rapidly here on the island.
Basitin Soldier: Curfew takes effect at the last light of day. Please make your way with haste.
Trace: Oh, alright. I‚Äôll get Flora.
Trace: Flora! Hey, we gotta go.
Flora: Trace! I found one!
Trace: Oh, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ great! One what?
Flora: It‚Äôs a subtle flower. They‚Äôre usually quite rare.
Flora: It‚Äôs just like what‚Äôs in my necklace.
Flora: If I give you this, it will signify that we are a couple‚Ä¶
Trace: Flora, we‚Äôve been sleeping together for over a month‚Ä¶ I think that makes us a couple by now.
Flora: Oh, well‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ But we kinda got rushed into things back then. You gave me the necklace by mistake‚Ä¶ But this would make things‚Ä¶ official, I guess‚Ä¶
Flora: I mean, if you want it.
Trace: Of course I do, Flora.Eric: A little more to the right‚Ä¶
Eric: That‚Äôs perfect! Wonderful, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get some great paintings done of the Basitin ladies.
Eric: They make such lovely subjects. Don‚Äôt you agree, Kathrin?
Kat: Oh, yes, Eric! I‚Äôm sure they would! They‚Äôre so cute with their long ears‚Ä¶
Eric: Right‚Ä¶ cute‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be going for‚Ä¶
Evals: Alright, Master, can I please return to the ship?
Eric: Eh? Oh, no. Curfew is upon us, you‚Äôll have to stay here until the morning.
Evals: What, morning?!
Evals: (thoughts) Drat! Looks like Mike‚Äôll get to sleep easy tonight.
Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Mike: I‚Äôm not giving a show for that dog! Where is he, anyways? He‚Äôs trying to get me to lower my guard, no doubt!
Mike: Well it won‚Äôt work! I‚Äôll stay up all night if I must!Trace: You alright, Flora? You‚Äôve been quiet since we got back.
Flora: I‚Äôm fine, Trace. Just enjoying the scenery. This island is beautiful.
Flora: I am a bit tired, though.
Trace: I‚Äôve noticed you‚Äôve been getting tired earlier than usual. Hope you‚Äôre not coming down with something.
Trace: We should probably get to bed early.
Narration: Several rooms down‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) I told you! I don‚Äôt need your‚Ä¶ chivalry! I‚Äôm perfectly fine on the ground!
Keith: (in Keidran) And I told you, I don‚Äôt need the stupid bed! Just take it and be comfortable!
Natani: (in Keidran) You slept on the floor for me last time! Now I should be the one to do it! Stop being so stubborn!Narration: The next morning‚Ä¶
Nickolai: Hey, Keith! It‚Äôs me, Alaric! Are you up yet?
Nickolai: The sun‚Äôs already up! Don‚Äôt tell me banishment has made you soft.
Keith: Aaaah!
Natani: Aaaah!
Nickolai: Hey, Keith! You‚Äôre up, good!
Keith: Erm‚Ä¶ hi, Alaric‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) What‚Ä¶ what just happened?Flora: Come on, Trace! Wake up, sleepyhead! It‚Äôs morning, the sun‚Äôs up!
Trace: Alright, alright! I‚Äôm awake.
Flora: You know what that means, right?
Flora: We‚Äôve managed to spend an entire day in a town without anything going wrong!
Trace: ‚ÄúGoing wrong?‚Äù
Trace: What do you mean by that?
Flora: Well‚Ä¶ in the first town Keith tried to kill me‚Ä¶ Then, in the second a Templar tried to kill us and you tried to kill me‚Ä¶
Flora: After that I was possessed by Neutral and tried to kill everyone.
Flora: On the day we reached the port Natani tried to kill us‚Ä¶ Then we were attacked by those three guys‚Äî
Trace: Okay, okay! I get it, bad stuff happens to us around towns‚Ä¶
Flora: But‚Ä¶ I think things are going to be better here. I feel like we‚Äôve finally gotten far enough away from the war.Basitin Soldier: Well, there‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt see very often‚Ä¶
Basitin Soldier: A dragon bathing in the harbor.
Basitin Soldier: Excuse me, Mister Dragon, sir?
Basitin Soldier: Could you move a little to the side, please?
Nora: (thoughts) That‚Äôs ‚ÄúMiss Dragon, Ma‚Äôam.‚Äù And why should I move aside?
Basitin Soldier: Sorry. Ma‚Äôam. Well, obviously we can‚Äôt make you move.
Basitin Soldier: However, you are blocking some of the fishing boats from entering and leaving. We‚Äôd appreciate it if you could.
Nora: (thoughts) Hrmph, Basitins. At least Humans and Keidran have the courtesy to run away when I do that.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Nickolai: Before we go on, there is something I must warn you, Keith‚Ä¶ What I‚Äôm about to show you is for your eyes only.
Nickolai: You must never speak of this to any of your new‚Ä¶ friends. Not to anyone. That‚Äôs an order. No one shall hear about it from you.
Nickolai: No one. Do you understand?
Keith: Y-yes, sir!
Nickolai: Great! Let‚Äôs get going, then! It‚Äôs being built in the eastern courtyard.
Nickolai: Ah, here we go! It‚Äôs just beyond these ridiculously large doors!Evals: Heehee‚Ä¶
Evals: Oh, Mike~!
Evals: Wakey wakey!
Mike: Neh?! Ah! Get away, you pervert!
Evals: Heeey, it‚Äôs just me, Buddy!
Mike: I know it‚Äôs you! H-how did you get in here? I thought I blocked the door.
Evals: Mike, our room doors open outward, remember?
Evals: ?
Mike: Oh‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ I forgot about that.Flora: Nya! The weather‚Äôs so nice today!
Trace: ‚ÄúNice?‚Äù It‚Äôs a bit on the chilly side, don‚Äôt you think?
Flora: Hm‚Ä¶? Oh, right, you don‚Äôt have any fur! Well, I could help keep you warm.
Trace: Hey, it‚Äôs a dragon! Isn‚Äôt that‚Ä¶ what was her name‚Ä¶?
Flora: Lady Nora? Yeah, I think that is her. She followed us?
Trace: ‚Ä¶..
Trace: Actually, Flora, would you mind waiting here, just for a bit?
Flora: Huh‚Ä¶? Oh, uh, sure, Trace. No problem.
Trace: Thanks, I won‚Äôt be gone long, Flora‚Ä¶
Flora: Aaaw‚Ä¶ Trace doesn‚Äôt want me to go with him?Eric: ‚ô™Hmmm hmm hmm~! ‚ô´
[Anatomy of a Keidran]
Eric: Ah! What a shame! For such a beauty to be confined under so many layers!
Flora: Mrow‚Ä¶?
Eric: A pity, really, that the Basitins are so strict. Though, I do know a private area where we could go‚Ä¶ If you ever wished to relax while not hindered by so much clothing.
Flora: Eric‚Ä¶ After all this time you‚Äôre still trying to get into my pants?
Eric: Into your pants? Me? Of course not! ‚Ä¶but if you want to, I suppose‚Ä¶Keith: N-no‚Ä¶
Keith: This can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶
Keith: A Templar tower‚Ä¶ here?! Why?
Nickolai: So you‚Äôve seen them before. I‚Ä¶ will explain. It will take time, but‚Ä¶ First, Keith, your trial is set for tomorrow, and you must do something before then.
Nickolai: I have a mission for you, involving your‚Ä¶ friends‚Ä¶ which you will probably not like.
Nickolai: But when you follow through with it, you will be welcome among us again. Welcome with open arms.
Keith: I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand.Randal: Fair greeting, General Alaric.
Nickolai: Oh, good morning, Templar Randal.
Randal: Ah, this must be the friend you were talking about ‚Äî Keith, right? Good morning, I am Randal, Templar teacher and architect.
Keith: (in Basitin) Alaric‚Ä¶
Keith: (in Basitin) What is going on?! Humans‚Ä¶ in the castle? And Templar, no less?
Randal: (in Basitin) Actually, there is only one Templar here ‚Äî me. These others are my students.
Randal: (in Basitin) I understand, we Templar have a bad reputation. Some of it is warranted, I know. But that‚Äôs not the case now. We are here as a show of good will.
Nickolai: Keith, we know what we‚Äôre doing.
Nickolai: We are working with the humans towards a mutual interest. For too long now, we Basitin have gone without something the other races take for granted‚Ä¶
Keith: Magic‚Ä¶!Nora: (thoughts) I‚Äôm surprised you asked to talk with me, Trace. In private, even‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Getting tired of playing with the furred ones?
Trace: What? No‚Ä¶ I mean, not really‚Ä¶
Trace: I wanted to ask you more about my past. Who I was and what I did. You seemed to know me personally.
Nora: (thoughts) Oh, yes. Quite‚Ä¶ personally.
Trace: Was I really as bad as they all say? I want to know why I built those towers‚Ä¶
Trace: Why was I trying to instigate a war?
Nora: (thoughts) I‚Äôm under orders not to tell anyone about anything you were doing! And to make sure nobody asks‚Ä¶
Trace: O-okay, then. Ah‚Ä¶ who ordered you to do that?
Nora: (thoughts) Why, you did, of course.Trace: But‚Ä¶ if I told you not to tell anyone‚Ä¶ Couldn‚Äôt I undo that order?
Nora: (thoughts) Yes, Trace could. Tell me, though, are you the same person who gave me the order?
Trace: Wha‚Äî? Of course I am! I‚Äôm Trace!
Nora: (thoughts) Oh, you look like Trace, but you don‚Äôt talk or act like him.
Trace: My memories were taken. You know I‚Äôm still the same person!
Nora: (thoughts) Same body, but altered mind. In the end, it is the mind that really matters.
Nora: (thoughts) So are you‚Äî?
Trace: Would you quit with all these mind games, Nora?
Trace: I AM TRACE!
Nora: (thoughts) Okay, Trace‚Ä¶ I certainly recognize your magical aura‚Ä¶ it makes my scales quiver‚Ä¶ I think my question‚Äôs been answered. Ask, and I will answer any I can.
Trace: Fine, tell me about my past‚Äî all of it. I want to know who I really am.Nora: I admit, I don‚Äôt know much about your childhood before the Templar found you. Your parents were farmers from a rural village.
Sirus: Ah, the new student. I‚Äôve been expecting him. This way, please.
Templar 1: This will be your new home. I think you will enjoy it here.
Nora: But even then, as I watched you arrive for the first time, I knew you were not like the others.
Nora: As the years passed, you learned quicker than any of your peers. You had very few friends, but it didn‚Äôt seem to bother you.
Nora: When you reached adulthood at 16, you became a full-fledged Templar.
Templar 2: You‚Äôve made us very proud, Trace. I expect great things from you.
Nora: By then, we spoke regularly. You seemed very happy those days.
Nora: But the happiness didn‚Äôt last. After two years, you were becoming frustrated. You often told me they were wasting your talents.
Nora: You were still a teenager. You wanted adventure, not going on escort missions or finding a farmer‚Äôs runaway property. But you were living in a time of relative peace. Humans and keidran were cooperating. So your frustrations continued unabated.
Nora: That all changed when you met her ‚Äî Saria au Gruhen. Oh, Trace, you should have seen yourself. You were so cute.
Nora: You may have ended up a power-hungry megalomaniac, but like I said, back then you were still a teenager.Nora: Unfortunately, you were quite clueless when it came to attracting a woman‚Äôs attention. You tried several indirect methods‚Ä¶
Trace: Die, beast!
Nora: Hiss!
Nora: Including‚Ä¶ ‚Äúfighting‚Äù a dragon for her honor‚Ä¶
Nora: Unsurprisingly‚Ä¶
Trace: This isn‚Äôt working! She doesn‚Äôt even notice!
Nora: (thoughts) It‚Äôs fun, though! I keep telling you, just go talk to her, Little One.
Trace: I can‚Äôt do that! I don‚Äôt even know her!
Nora: (thoughts) That‚Äôs the point of talking, is it not?
Mary: NORA! TRACE!
Trace: G-grand Templar?
Mary: What have you done to my courtyard?!
Nora: Okay, in hindsight, maybe it wasn‚Äôt such a good idea to stage our fight in the Grand Templar‚Äôs front lawn.
Mary: Get back here!
Trace: Eep!
Trace: Eh‚Ä¶ why are you running? You‚Äôre a freakin‚Äô dragon!
Nora: (thoughts) I know, but she‚Äôs still scary when she‚Äôs mad like that! Keep running!
Nora: After paying for the damages and swearing not to destroy the academy for a third time, you finally worked up the nerve to actually talk to her.
Saria: Nice to meet you, Trace.
Nora: Amazing how much better that worked‚Ä¶Nora: You began courting her in the fall.
Nora: And by the first of winter, you were married.
Nora: You purchased a home that was quite large for a human dwelling, and moved in immediately. Hm, you made a lovely couple.
Nora: For once, you actually seemed content with your place in life. You didn‚Äôt completely shelve your Templar ambitions, but you set them aside.
Nora: That isn‚Äôt to say things were perfect. The first time you bought a slave for the house‚Ä¶ Saria, usually so shy and soft-spoken, had a lot to say about it.
Nora: I think everyone in town heard that argument.
Nora: But despite your dramatically different personalities and conflicting ideals‚Ä¶
Nora: Somehow, you two seemed to be made for each other.Nora: Everything was going well until that last week in late spring. This was six seasons ago‚Ä¶
Nora: You were traveling to your cabin in the forest, very near the Keidran borderline.
Girl: Run, it‚Äôs a tiger!
Flora: Rawr! Heehee!
Flora: Mew?
Saria: Aw, look! That little keidran‚Äôs waving at us! How cute!
Trace: Huh? Oh, sure.
Nora: I regret that I left before it happened. I later gleaned from various minds and pieced together the events that took place on that day.Nora: It was a wolf. Not a professional assassin or mercenary. Just some petty thief trying to take advantage of a couple of isolated humans.
Nora: The first arrow was for Saria.
Saria: Ah!
Trace: Saria, what happened? Are you okay?
Saria: Y-yes, I think‚Ä¶
Nora: And the second arrow was for you.
Trace: Get down!
Wolf: (in Keidran) Oh, crap! A Templar!
Trace: A keidran!
Trace: Saria, are you sure you‚Äôre okay?
Saria: It just grazed me, I‚Äôll be okay.
Trace: Go inside and lock the door. The house‚Äôs wards will protect you. I‚Äôm going after it!
Saria: Trace! Please be careful!
Nora: It wasn‚Äôt your fault, Trace. You couldn‚Äôt have known.Trace: So‚Ä¶ it killed her‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Yes, the poison spread throughout her body. She died before you could return.
Trace: And that‚Äôs why I did all those terrible things.
Nora: (thoughts) Yes.. and no. Your wife‚Äôs death was the start‚Ä¶
Nora: But it was what you did afterwards that pushed you over the edge. You tried to bring her back.
Nora: In theory, it‚Äôs possible to resurrect someone by stealing the life energy of other things. This is what you know as dark magic. But in practice, it‚Äôs impossible. The dark energy kills the caster before the spell can finish.
Nora: By the time you were found, you were half-dead. Your mind had been nearly destroyed by the black magic you had attempted.
Nora: The black magic‚Äôs effects on your mind warped your senses. You became crazed and paranoid.
Nora: For two years, you locked yourself away in your home, rarely leaving for anything.
Nora: And then four years ago, you emerged and proclaimed yourself Grand Templar.
Nora: You had the old Master Templars killed, and in their place, your own inner circle. Master Spy, Master Architect, Master Strategist, Master Seer, Master Mage.
Nora: With these men, you took control. And quickly the Templar changed from a mage guild, into an order to rival the military.Narration: Back at the ship‚Ä¶
Evals: Come on~! You promised!
Mike: No, you blackmailed me!
Evals: We‚Äôre friends, it‚Äôs no big deal!
Mike: No way!
Evals: I‚Äôd show you! We‚Äôre pals!
Mike: I‚Ä¶ said‚Ä¶
Mike: NO!
Mike: Woah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs weird. I‚Äôm smaller than I used to be‚Ä¶ but I feel as strong as before, and my reach seems the same. Maybe this really is just an illusion.
Mike: (thoughts) If that‚Äôs the case‚Ä¶ I should still be able to beat Evals in a fight‚Ä¶
Mike: Evals, the last two days have been nothing but stress. I just need to let off some steam. So if you want to do something useful for once, get up and fight me.
Evals: Fight you? I can‚Äôt do that‚Ä¶
Evals: You know I‚Äôd never strike a woman.
Mike: Then this is going to be a really one-sided fight!
Evals: No, wait! Aaah!Flora: Whatcha doing, Natani?
Natani: Just‚Ä¶ making a crude mana necklace. I‚Äôll be able to cast spells while leaving my hands open for weapons.
Flora: Oh, cool.
Laura: E-excuse me‚Ä¶
Natani: Hm?
Laura: I apologize for interrupting‚Ä¶ My name is Laura of the Coastal Fox Tribe. Do you know if a Basitin named Keith is staying here?
Laura: They‚Ä¶ told me this place is where I could find him.
Natani: You just missed him. He left with a general about an hour ago.
Laura: Oh‚Ä¶ I see‚Ä¶ T-thank you. Good afternoon.
Natani: ‚Ä¶who was that? I didn‚Äôt know other Keidran were on the island?
Flora: I dunno. Her name sounded familiar‚Ä¶
Flora: Wait, I remember‚Ä¶! Laura‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt that Keith‚Äôs ex-fianc√©e?
Natani: F-fianc√©e?!
Flora: Yeah. I wonder how she got here? Maybe she‚Äôs trying to get back together with him?
Natani: ‚Ä¶Keith: Alaric, I don‚Äôt understand. How could you have known I‚Äôd be here with Trace? The other general said you didn‚Äôt expect me.
Nickolai: I know. That‚Äôs true. Your mission to find Trace was suppose to be impossible, so you‚Äôd be banished forever. But against all odds you did it!
Nickolai: We honestly had no ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù plans for him. But now that he‚Äôs here, the Templar are demanding Trace be returned.
Nickolai: I don‚Äôt like taking orders from them, but building this Tower gives them leverage. If giving them Trace is what it takes‚Ä¶
Nickolai: Look, Trace isn‚Äôt your concern anyways.
Nickolai: We‚Äôre going to take care of that one ourselves. The problem is, the Templar believe his friends know too much now.
Keith: ‚Ä¶What do you mean?
Nickolai: Well, the human known as Eric, his slaves, and the tiger aren‚Äôt immediate threats. The only one we‚Äôre concerned about is the wolf. The Templar believe he‚Äôs a spy. They want him removed. The other generals wish to‚Ä¶ test your loyalty.
Keith: Wait‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre asking me to‚Ä¶ to kill Natani?
Nickolai: We‚Äôre not asking, Keith. I‚Äôm ordering you to kill the wolf known as Natani before your trial tomorrow morning.Keith: (thoughts) What am I going to do?
Nickolai: I‚Äôm sorry to put all this on you so soon after you‚Äôve returned.
Nickolai: But it‚Äôs still before noon. You have a whole day to complete the mission. Which means‚Ä¶ you have time to see what I really wanted to show you!
Nickolai: Ta-da!
Keith: W-what is that?
Nickolai: It‚Äôs you! A tribute to the banished warrior!
Nickolai: I started it six months ago as a pet project. I guessed on your proportions.
Nickolai: I thought you‚Äôd be taller, but it‚Äôs close! Good thing you still have all your limbs intact! Yet, I couldn‚Äôt finish your‚Ä¶ details‚Ä¶ without you being here!
Nickolai: But now that you finally are, I can!
Nickolai: So, do you like it?
Keith: Er‚Ä¶ why am I‚Ä¶ naked?
Nickolai: Oh, you‚Äôre not! Well, not completely!
Nickolai: See? Covered. So it‚Äôs decent.Keith: Alaric, is this really necessary?
Nickolai: Don‚Äôt worry, Keith! I only need an hour or two of your time. I can‚Äôt finish this statue of you without you modeling for me!
Keith: ‚Ä¶Sigh‚Ä¶
Keith: But do I have to be naked? Doesn‚Äôt this violate a dozen decency laws?
Nickolai: No, no, of course not! I can‚Äôt order you to do anything if it violates any laws. And I‚Äôve studied the laws carefully. Since this is for artistic purposes, it‚Äôs exempt from the decency laws!
Nickolai: Now just hold that pose and I‚Äôll get to work!
Keith: ‚Ä¶Great‚Ä¶ What else could possibly go wrong today?
Basitin Soldier: Keith Keiser? He‚Äôs with General Alaric. They‚Äôre in Alaric‚Äôs private stone-working room. It‚Äôs down the hall and to the right.
Laura: Oh, t-thank you.Laura: Okay, this is it‚Ä¶ Keith should be right behind this door‚Ä¶
Laura: Now all I have to do is‚Ä¶ open this d-door and talk to him‚Ä¶
Laura: (thoughts) But‚Ä¶ what if Keith hates me? What if he doesn‚Äôt even remember me? W-why would he? It‚Äôs been more than five years ‚Äî a quarter of a lifetime. And I‚Äôm getting old. He wouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Laura: (thoughts) N-no! I‚Äôve been a coward all my life. I can‚Äôt be nervous, not now! Not when I‚Äôm so close! I j-just have to try and‚Ä¶ imagine he‚Äôs in his underwear! That‚Äôs supposed to help‚Ä¶
Laura: (thoughts) Alright! Here goes!
Laura: K-Keith!
Laura: You probably don‚Äôt remember me but I-!
Laura: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶o-oh no! I‚Ä¶ I imagined too hard!Keith: L-Laura‚Ä¶?
Keith: Kyaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Laura: Ah! S-sorry, sorry!
Laura: I d-didn‚Äôt know y-you were.. busy‚Ä¶! I-I‚Äôll wait outside!
Nickolai: That couldn‚Äôt have gone more perfectly! You should have seen the look on your face!
Keith: You.
Keith: This was your doing! You know she‚Äôd be here! This was all a prank?!
Nickolai: Aw, don‚Äôt be mad at me, Keith. It wasn‚Äôt all a prank. I really did need you to help finish my statue. But for now, go ahead and go with your lady friend. We‚Äôll continue later.
Narration: A short while later‚Ä¶
Keith: I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ sorry you had to see that, Laura.
Laura: I-it‚Äôs alright, Keith‚Ä¶
Laura: (thoughts) O-oh no‚Ä¶ I had this moment planned out for years‚Ä¶
Laura: (thoughts) Now I can‚Äôt think of what to say. I can‚Äôt stop picturing him naked!Flora: (thoughts) Trace has been gone a long time. It looks like it might storm soon. I hope he‚Äôs alright.
Flora: Gah! Eric, you pervert! Stop touching my tail!
Trace: Ack!
Trace: Flora, wait! Calm down! It‚Äôs just me!
Flora: O-oh no! Trace, you‚Äôre back! I‚Äôm sorry!
Flora: Are you alright? I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt you.
Trace: Heh, I‚Äôm fine, Flora. I guess I should have known better than to sneak up from behind and grab the tail of a tiger. Next time I might not get away so lucky!
Flora: Oh, don‚Äôt say that, Trace! I didn‚Äôt mean to.
Trace: I know you didn‚Äôt, Flora.Keith: ?
Natani: ?
Keith: üíß
Merry Christmas!Flora: So where did you go? You were gone for more than an hour.
Trace: An hour?
Trace: I didn‚Äôt realize it‚Äôd been that long, I‚Äôm sorry.
Trace: I was talking to the dragon about‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ where we‚Äôll be going after we‚Äôre done here.
Trace: I have it marked on the map if‚Äî
Flora: I‚Äôm just glad you‚Äôre back, Trace! It‚Äôs so boring without you here.
Trace: Oh, well, maybe we can go out and find something fun to do.
Tavernkeeper: Ehem! Do you two mind? Intimate contact is prohibited by law, and I won‚Äôt have it in my tavern! And ignorance of the law is no excuse! If you feel you simply must‚Ä¶ touch one another, you can do it in your own rooms!
Flora: Aw, come on! Laws about how we dress‚Ä¶ Laws keeping us here at the docks‚Ä¶ Now laws against even touching?!
Flora: What‚Äôs with these people and all their rules?!
Tavernkeeper: No yelling!
Tavernkeeper: Damn Keidran‚Ä¶
Flora: ‚Ä¶Trace, smite him.
Trace: Wha‚Äî? Flora!
Flora: I know you can! Just set his pants on fire or something, come on!Trace: Alright‚Ä¶
Trace: Here‚Äôs the world map.
Trace: And this is where Nora said it was.
Trace: Even on horseback it‚Äôs a long distance, but if we reach it, we‚Äôll finally be safe.
Flora: A place where humans and keidran live together‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ this takes us right through my homeland‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace, this is dangerous!
Trace: ‚ÄúDangerous?‚Äù Why?
Flora: Trace, don‚Äôt you remember what you are? You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ a human! My people have very little interaction with your kind. Most haven‚Äôt even seen a human before!
Flora: And if they found out you are‚Ä¶ were a Templar‚Ä¶
Trace: I know what you mean, but it‚Äôs the only way there. If we tried going in from the north-west or east, it‚Äôd take months longer. The reason it‚Äôs so well hidden is due to the fact that it‚Äôs difficult to reach from the human side.
Trace: We can figure out what to do when the time comes. It‚Äôll work out, I‚Äôm sure.
Flora: I hope so.Trace: (in Human) Flora, what about Natani? Where will he be going? With us?
Flora: (in Human) Oh, I hadn‚Äôt thought of that! I‚Äôll ask him!
Flora: Natani, are you‚Ä¶ huh? Where did he go?
Zen: (thoughts) Natani? Where are you going?
Natani: (thoughts) I just needed some fresh air.
Zen: (thoughts) You know you‚Äôre supposed to be spying on the human. Yet you haven‚Äôt been spending much time around him‚Ä¶
Natani: How am I supposed to spy on people I can‚Äôt even understand? Besides, I‚Äôm just going for a walk.
Natani: Is there something wrong with that?
Zen: (thoughts) Just a walk, huh? Doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the scent trail of a certain basitin you‚Äôre following?
Natani: (thoughts) T-that‚Äôs a coincidence! This has nothing to do with Keith!
Natani: I just happen to be going in the same direction his scent is going‚Ä¶Laura: W-when I heard you‚Äôd left the village‚Ä¶ I realized how much of a mistake I‚Äôd made in running away.
Laura: For weeks I tried to catch up with you, to e-explain why‚Ä¶ But you crossed the human border. I had to turn back.
Laura: I returned home, but I couldn‚Äôt stop regretting what had happened. I couldn‚Äôt stand it! I tried the only way I could think of to reach you.
Laura: Half a year ago, I left everything and came here. The basitins were kind to me. They let me stay, but told me you‚Äôd never return from banishment.
Natani: There he is!
Laura: I didn‚Äôt care. I had made up my mind to see you again, or die waiting.
Laura: A-and‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how I ended up here‚Ä¶ All so I could say‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶Keith: But you still haven‚Äôt told me why you left.
Laura: ‚Ä¶Honestly, there is n-no good reason why. There‚Äôs nothing that I could say to excuse what I did, but I can try to explain.
Laura: Though my p-parents approved of our union, when you weren‚Äôt around they expressed to me their apprehension. They were‚Ä¶ a bit frightened of you.
Laura: The whole village was. None had ever seen a basitin before, but there were so many terrible rumors about your race going around.
Laura: Especially once you proposed. So many people told me what a mistake I was making.
Laura: I didn‚Äôt believe them, I-I knew it wasn‚Äôt true what they were saying. B-but I became overwhelmed, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to think.
Laura: Eventually, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I p-panicked and ran.
Laura: I n-never intended to stay away. I just wanted time to think. But once I ran, I didn‚Äôt know what to do.
Laura: I was ashamed. I didn‚Äôt know how to face you again. So I stayed hidden, even when I heard you calling for me.
Laura: I t-thought I had time to pull myself together. I didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd leave and never come back.Keith: You‚Ä¶
Keith: You mean all of this, everything‚Ä¶ was because you couldn‚Äôt talk to me? I looked for you for days, until I was forced out of the village. They told me you didn‚Äôt want to see me again.
Keith: Do you realize how that made me feel?! And you could have prevented everything!
Laura: Whimper‚Ä¶
Laura: I-I‚Äôm sorry. I never wanted you to be hurt. I know it‚Äôs my f-fault‚Ä¶
Keith: Hey, stop. Get up! You can‚Äôt‚Äî not in the middle of the street‚Ä¶
Keith: (thoughts) Damn it, I shouldn‚Äôt be the one feeling guilty! It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ just one thing after another! What more am I going to have to endure today?
Keith: Sigh‚Ä¶Natani: What‚Äôs wrong with her? A little yelling and she bursts into tears.
Natani: Tch, women‚Ä¶
Zen: ‚Äîsnirk‚Äî
Natani: Oh, don‚Äôt even start, Zen!
Keith: Laura, I‚Äôm sorry for yelling at you, I lost my temper‚Ä¶
Keith: To be honest, ever since I last saw you, I‚Äôve wished for the day I‚Äôd see you again.
Keith: I don‚Äôt want to ruin this by fighting. Let‚Äôs just talk.
Keith: Laura, I am glad you‚Äôre here. Please, stop crying.
Laura: Keith‚Ä¶Flora: Aw‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs raining.
Trace: Sorry, Flora, looks like we‚Äôll have to find something to do indoors, instead.
Kat: Oh, hello, Mr. Trace. Need something to do? My offer still stands on my services.
Trace: Er, hello, Kat. S-services?
Kat: Oh yes! Master Eric says it‚Äôs very relaxing.
Trace: I‚Äôm almost afraid to ask, but‚Ä¶ What exactly are the‚Ä¶ ‚Äúservices‚Äù you keep offering?
Kat: Why, my special massages, of course! What else would it be?
Kat: I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm quite good, but I‚Äôd love the practice.
Trace: Oh, a massage! Well, that actually sounds quite nice‚Äî
Trace: Er‚Ä¶
Trace: I-I mean, no!
Trace: No, that‚Äôs okay, thanks. I‚Äôm not interested.Kat: Alright, no problem. Oh, by the way‚Ä¶ Master Eric wishes to speak with you about when we‚Äôll depart.
Trace: Oh, okay.
Trace: Sorry, Flora.
Trace: I‚Äôll be back soon. I just need to go over that map with Eric.
Flora: Alright. I‚Äôll be here.
Flora: Oh, I shouldn‚Äôt have glared at Trace like that. A massage is harmless, and I trust him. I know he wouldn‚Äôt do anything.
Flora: I shouldn‚Äôt let my jealousy get the best of me.
Kat: I understand, Flora. Hey! Why don‚Äôt I teach you how? I know, I‚Äôll give you a massage!
Flora: M-me?
Flora: Oh no, I‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Especially not after having guilted Trace out of one‚Ä¶
Kat: Oh, don‚Äôt be silly! It‚Äôll be fun! I‚Äôll teach you how to do it, and then you can give the massage to Trace.
Kat: And I‚Äôm sure Trace won‚Äôt mind. In fact, I think he‚Äôd be happy just to watch me do you.
Flora: (thoughts) I swear she said it like that on purpose.
Flora: (thoughts) No one could possible be so naive as to not realize how that sounds‚Ä¶Evals: No more, stop!
Evals: I give up, you win!
Evals: You‚Äôre still a better fighter than I am!
Mike: Huff‚Ä¶ Good.
Evals: Phew‚Ä¶
Evals: Hey‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry for the last couple days, Mike. I guess I just got‚Ä¶ over-excited.
Evals: We‚Äôve been friends since we were kids‚Ä¶ even despite the fighting between the fox and dog tribe.
Evals: And I wouldn‚Äôt want to do anything to hurt that friendship.
Evals: So, I‚Äôll do everything I can to help get you back to your normal self.
Mike: ‚Ä¶..
Evals: H-hey, what are-?
Mike: Look, don‚Äôt make a big deal out of this. I just feel guilty for beating you up.Laura: Keith, does this mean‚Ä¶? Can we‚Ä¶?
Keith: ‚Ä¶Laura, I‚Äôve forgiven you for what you did. But‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Laura: Oh‚Ä¶ I understand. Is there‚Ä¶ someone else..?
Keith: Someone else‚Ä¶? No! I mean‚Ä¶ not really. Look, I just‚Ä¶ need some time to think.
Keith: There‚Äôs a lot going on right now. More than you know.
Keith: I just.. sigh.. I need time. And I think there‚Äôs someone I need to talk to first‚Ä¶
Natani: Wait‚Ä¶ Is‚Ä¶ is he talking about me?
Keith: Come on, Laura, get up. Let‚Äôs get out of this rain. I‚Äôll see if I can get you a room at the inn I‚Äôm staying at.Natani: Hah, made it back just in time!
Natani: I need to get back to my room!
Tavernkeeper: Hey! At least shake off the water outside! I just mopped the floor!
Eric: (in Human) So it‚Äôs agreed. I‚Äôll take you where you need to go. I‚Äôll give this map to my crew when the rain stops.
Tavernkeeper: Ah! How many of you are there?
Tavernkeeper: Look at the mess you‚Äôre making!
Laura: I-I‚Äôm so sorry, Sir‚Ä¶
Eric: (in Human) Wait! I sense‚Ä¶
Trace: (in Human) Though, Eric, I‚Äôm not sure Flora will agree again to‚Äî Eric? Where‚Äôd he go?
Eric: Why, hello there, my dear!
Laura: Ack! A‚Ä¶ a h-h-human!Eric: A pleasure to meet you!
Laura: W-hat are you doing with my hand? Please don‚Äôt eat me!
Laura: I taste terrible, I swear!
Trace: (in Human) Hey, what‚Äôs going on? Who‚Äôs this?
Laura: Ah!
Laura: Y-You!
Trace: Kill my wife, will you?
Laura: I know you!
Laura: B‚Äî how‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not possible! You can‚Äôt be here! Not you! Demon! Sin! Y-you‚Ä¶
Laura: Ah‚Ä¶
Keith: Laura!
Trace: (in Human) ‚Ä¶What did I do?Natani: Dang it‚Ä¶
Natani: I forgot I don‚Äôt have anything to change into. ‚Ä¶And Keith‚Äôs going to be back any minute.
Natani: (thoughts) I wonder if it was really me he was talking about? Is he going to ask me my opinion on that fox girl? ‚Ä¶No‚Ä¶ why would he?
Natani: (thoughts) But what if he does? I could tell him getting back with her would be a mistake! After all, they‚Äôre nothing alike. She‚Äôs a wimp!
Natani: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶B-but, it‚Äôs not like it matters to me! I should tell him to go ahead! Whatever makes him happy. Why should I care?
Natani: (thoughts) Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll say! If he asks, I‚Äôll say ‚Äúgo ahead!‚Äù
Natani: (thoughts) Alright, here goes‚Ä¶
Keith: Oh, Natani‚Ä¶ why are you all wet?
Natani: Don‚Äôt do it, Keith! You deserve better! You two have nothing in common!
Keith: ‚Ä¶What?
Natani: (thoughts) What?!Natani: (in Keidran) W-wait! I didn‚Äôt mean that! Forget it!
Keith: (thoughts) Did she just say‚Ä¶?
Laura: Keith, I found the towels‚Ä¶ Oh,
Laura: (in Keidran) h-hello.
Keith: Ah, Laura!
Keith: This is Natani, a‚Ä¶ friend.
Keith: (in Keidran) Natani, this is Laura.
Laura: (in Keidran) I-It‚Äôs nice to meet you again, Natani.
Natani: (in Keidran) ‚Ä¶Hi‚Ä¶
Laura: The tavern owner gave me a room, he said it just opened up. I t-think I‚Äôm going to go lie down.
Keith: Oh, okay‚Ä¶
Laura: I figured I should give you some space. You said you needed time to think. Take all the time you need, Keith.
Keith: Thank you, Laura.
Laura: (in Keidran) Oh, you‚Äôre wet too. Here, take mine. You‚Äôd better get out of those wet clothes. You might catch a cold.
Natani: (thoughts) She‚Äôs so nice‚Ä¶ No wonder Keith likes her.
Natani: (thoughts) She‚Äôs the complete opposite of me.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Flora: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶Where did this massage table come from?
Kat: This is going to be fun! I don‚Äôt often get a chance to do other Keidran!
Kat: I‚Äôve got a whole grooming kit I can finally try out.
Flora: H-hey! Why are you taking off your clothes?
Kat: Well, this is the only way I‚Äôve ever done it! Besides, how else am I going to perform the second part of the massage?
Flora: S-second part?
Kat: Oh yes, a special technique I learned from one of Eric‚Äôs books! I just take the oil, and then massage each part of your body‚Ä¶
Kat: ‚Ä¶using every part of mine‚Ä¶
Flora: Geh‚Äî! ‚Ä¶Kat, let‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ stick with a normal massage, okay?
Kat: Aww‚Ä¶Flora: Ooooh‚Ä¶ Puuurrrr~!
Kat: Hah! I told you you‚Äôd enjoy it. It seems like you needed a massage. You had a lot of built up tension.
Kat: Alright, turn around.
Flora: Around‚Ä¶?
Kat: This is a full body massage! There‚Äôs still a lot more I can do.
Kat: Trust me, you‚Äôll enjoy ‚Äî oh!
Kat: Wait, Flora‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre‚Ä¶Flora: ‚Ä¶What? What‚Äôs wrong?
Kat: You‚Äôre‚Ä¶
Kat: You‚Äôre getting kinda pudgy, Flora! Heehee! You‚Äôre a‚Ä¶ tubby tiger!
Kat: Tubby Tiger! ‚ô™ ‚ô´ Tubby Tiger!
Kat: WAAAAAAAAAAH!!
Flora: I‚Äôll have you know I‚Äôm perfectly happy with my figure, you bimbo!
Flora: Get back here and I‚Äôll‚Äî eh?
Flora: Where‚Äôd all the Keiths come from?
Flora: And why are they all staring at me?Trace: Flora, there you are!
Trace: And‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre naked again‚Ä¶
Tavernkeeper: That‚Äôs it! That Keidran of yours has broken our most basic laws! She needs to be detained!
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶
Trace: Detained? You‚Äôre not going anywhere with her!
Tavernkeeper: Out of the way, Human! You have no say in this‚Ä¶
Trace: (in Basitin) Then I‚Äôll make it my say! I declare this Keidran as my mate. Now, according to your own laws‚Ä¶
Trace: (in Basitin) Declared mates are treated with equal status, protected from orders to harm one another, and share political immunities. Therefore, Flora has the same diplomatic immunity as I do. You can‚Äôt touch her.
Basitin Soldier: (in Basitin) He‚Ä¶ knows our language and our laws! But‚Ä¶ surely a Human declaring a Keidran his mate?!
Tavernkeeper: (in Basitin) Sigh‚Ä¶ the law doesn‚Äôt specify‚Ä¶ Fine, Human. You win. She can go, for now.
Flora: Wow, Trace, that was amazing! But how did you know their language?
Trace: ‚Ä¶Language?Natani: (thoughts) How do I keep getting into situations like this?
Natani: You don‚Äôt expect me to get undressed with you in here too, do you? You probably want that, right?
Natani: You enjoy this, don‚Äôt you?
Keith: Oh, don‚Äôt flatter yourself. Actually, I‚Äôd enjoy it if you dried off just so you no longer have that wet dog smell.
Natani: üíò
Keith: It‚Äôs not like I want to be here any more than you.
Natani: Well‚Ä¶ fine! Then maybe we should both just sit here and do nothing then!
Keith: Fine!
Keith: Hmph‚Ä¶
Natani: Hmph‚Ä¶Keith: Ah-choo!
Natani: (thoughts) He‚Äôs shivering‚Ä¶
Natani: I thought you said basitins didn‚Äôt get sick.
Keith: Hm? We don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ normally‚Ä¶
Keith: It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs not a lot of things that affect basitins, but being wet and cold is one of them. If you can‚Äôt tell by our short fur, we‚Äôre better suited for warmer climates.
Natani: Well don‚Äôt suffer on my account! Dry off!
Keith: ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm fine. If you can stand it, I can.
Natani: (thoughts) He‚Äôs suffering because of me‚Ä¶
Natani: ‚Ä¶Keith, the door‚Äôs locked, right?
Keith: Yeah, and bolted too, this time.
Keith: Why‚Äî what are you doing?
Natani: Just sitting here soaking wet is stupid. I won‚Äôt look if you don‚Äôt, alright?Flora: I dunno, I think it‚Äôs kinda neat.
Trace: Neat? Weird‚Äôs more like it. I know a language I didn‚Äôt yesterday‚Ä¶
Flora: What did you say, anyway?
Trace: Oh‚Ä¶ well, I‚Ä¶ I just told them you were with me, so they couldn‚Äôt touch you. Diplomatic immunity.‚Äù
Flora: Ah‚Ä¶
Flora: So‚Ä¶ What did Eric say?
Trace: Eric? He agreed to the plan.
Trace: After we‚Äôre done and said our good-byes to Keith, we‚Äôll leave and head towards Lyn‚ÄôKnoll. It should take a lot less time than it did to sail out here. The island is much closer to the east coast than where we left.
Trace: He did have‚Ä¶ one condition though. For going out of his way, he wanted you to model for him some more‚Ä¶ er, once a week.
Flora: Once a‚Äî?! No! Wait‚Ä¶ You didn‚Äôt agree, did you?
Trace: Well‚Ä¶ yeah, we need the ship to get back.
Flora: Trace! Why would you do that?
Trace: Huh? What do you mean? You did it last time. Why are you getting upset about it?
Flora: I‚Äôm not getting upset because of Eric. I don‚Äôt like it, but I‚Äôd probably agree to it again if I was asked. I‚Äôm upset because you made the decision for me!Trace: Flora, what‚Äôs the big deal? You know Eric‚Äôs ship is one of our only options off this island. It‚Äôs a small price to pay.
Flora: That‚Äôs not the point, Trace! In case you‚Äôve forgotten, before I met you I was a slave.
Flora: I‚Äôve spent the majority of my life having people make decisions for me.
Flora: And I worked hard to escape from that life!
Flora: You don‚Äôt own me, Trace. You can‚Äôt just use me as boat fare. And if you can‚Äôt understand how something like that could hurt me, then maybe you‚Äôre even more clueless than I thought!
Trace: Flora, wait! Flora!Trace: (thoughts) Sigh‚Ä¶ Damn it. Flora‚Äôs right. I really must be clueless.
Trace: (thoughts) I never even thought how she might feel about it. I don‚Äôt know what Flora sees in me. I‚Äôve done nothing but put her in danger.
Basitin Soldier: Trace.
Trace: Hm? What is it?
Basitin Soldier: I am here to inform you that you have been summoned by the master general.
Trace: Sigh, alright. I‚Äôll go as soon as the rain stops.
Basitin Soldier: No. We need you to come with us now.
Trace: Huh, now? In this weather?
Basitin Soldier: (in Basitin) Take him to the Templars. They‚Äôll be leaving with him by morning. I‚Äôll be glad to see these humans gone.
Narration: End.Narration: Trace has been kidnapped, everyone is in danger, and everything hinges on the decisions of a single banished Basitin.Natani: Oh, would you shut up already!
Natani: You‚Äôre not helping!
Keith: W-what have I done now?
Natani: Er, Keith‚Ä¶ not you‚Ä¶ I was talking‚Ä¶ to Zen, my brother, in my‚Ä¶ head‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Thanks a lot, Brother. Now I look insane.Keith: Hm, did you say your brother?
Zen: Ow!
Keith: Oh, right‚Ä¶ The one I‚Ä¶ stabbed through the chest. I‚Äôd almost forgotten. ‚Ä¶Sorry. Is he-?
Natani: Oh, don‚Äôt worry. He‚Äôs fine. Healed and lazing about back at our village. Though now he spends all his days bugging me. I think you should have stabbed him harder.
Keith: Speaking of which‚Ä¶ You mentioned that ‚Äúlink‚Äù before, but you didn‚Äôt say much about it.
Keith: Is it something all you assassins have?
Natani: ‚Ä¶No. It‚Äôs not. It was because of our job as assassins, yes. But we were not linked by choice.Natani: I became linked with my brother after our very first ‚Äúsolo‚Äù mission for the Brotherhood.
Natani: It was supposed to be easy. Just kill an old wolf named Issac as he traveled alone between villages.
Issac: Assassins!
Young Natani: I‚Äôve got him!
Zen: Natani, wait!
Natani: What we didn‚Äôt know was that Issac knew forbidden magic, and was willing to use it.
Young Natani: Aaaagh!
Natani: The curse I was hit with was a terrible one. It didn‚Äôt hurt me physically, but rended my mind and damaged a portion of my soul. Although physically fine, I was as good as dead.
Zen: Natani!Healer: I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs nothing physically wrong with her. It‚Äôs part of her soul that‚Äôs missing. We cannot heal something like this.
Zen: Please‚Ä¶ there must be something‚Ä¶
Zen: I swore I‚Äôd watch over and protect her.
Zen: She‚Äôs all I have left‚Ä¶ I beg you, anything!
Healer: I‚Ä¶ ‚Äîsigh‚Äî there is one possibility‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ it would require your own sacrifice.
Natani: In order to save my life, my brother melded his soul with my own. His soul kept the pieces of mine together and filled in anything missing.
Natani: But the effects were irreversible.
Natani: Zen and I became permanently mentally linked.
Natani: And having his spirit in my body changed me. His mind filled in my missing pieces‚Ä¶ One happened to be my gender‚Ä¶ so I copied his.
Natani: And‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how I ended up being male in mind, and female in body.Natani: It took a while to adjust to being mentally linked to my brother. In the beginning, we didn‚Äôt know how to block out thoughts and sensations from each other.
Natani: Be more careful!
Natani: When I had a hangover, so did he.
Natani: When he went to the bathroom, I‚Ä¶ well, you get the idea.
Natani: It‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt pleasant.
Natani: Ironically, Issac, the wolf we were supposed to kill, died casting that curse. It‚Äôs forbidden magic for a reason‚Ä¶ It tends to kill its user.
Natani: So our mission was considered a success.
Natani: Rumor spread that we were such skilled assassins we had caused a powerful mage to kill himself.
Natani: The story became more and more exaggerated ‚Äî mostly by us while we were drunk ‚Äî until we eventually became known as the ‚ÄúMagi Brothers.‚Äù
Natani: He took one look at us and kill himself right on the spot! Honest!
Wolf: That‚Äôs amazing!Natani: And that‚Äôs the whole story.
Natani: You know, I‚Äôve never told anyone that before.
Keith: Am I the only one to find out about you?
Natani: Well, there were a few others early on‚Ä¶
Natani: Including a brat from way back when I first began my guild training, but‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶you‚Äôre the first in a very long time‚Ä¶
Keith: Ah, I see‚Ä¶
Natani: ‚Ä¶Keith, um‚Ä¶ listen‚Ä¶ Although I would have‚Ä¶ rather no one found out about me‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶how do I say this? I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ glad it was a person like you, at least. I appreciate you keeping my secret. It means a lot to me to know that, if for no one else, I can trust you.
Keith: ‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt mention it‚Ä¶Flora: Hey, Keith?
Keith: Er‚Ä¶ wait‚Ä¶
Keith: J-just a second‚Ä¶ Hang on!
Keith: Ah, uh, what do you need, Flora?
Flora: Keith, have you seen Trace? We kinda got into a fight, and I kicked him out. I felt bad about it, though, and I wanted to apologize, but‚Ä¶
Flora: I can‚Äôt find him anywhere!
Keith: (thoughts) Have they taken him already?
Keith: (thoughts) I thought that they were going to be waiting for me.
Keith: Sorry, Flora, I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know where he is.
Keith: (thoughts) Lying to my friends, now‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs no honor in any of this‚Ä¶Keith: (in Keidran) Alright, the coast is clear, Natani.
Natani: (in Keidran) Say, Keith, while you‚Äôre up, could you get me another towel? I‚Äôm still damp.
Keith: (in Keidran) What? I‚Äôm not wearing anything!
Natani: (in Keidran) The closet‚Äôs just down the hall! Please?
Keith: (in Keidran) Oh, alright.
Keith: (thoughts) Hmph‚Ä¶ At least it‚Äôll give me some time to think‚Ä¶
Basitin Soldier 1: (in Basitin) I‚Äôm telling you, something strange is going on‚Ä¶
Keith: Hm?
Basitin Soldier 1: (in Basitin) Haven‚Äôt you noticed it?
Basitin Soldier 1: (in Basitin) Ever since that tower began lighting up, the generals have all been behaving strangely. They‚Äôve been giving weird orders and acting erratically‚Ä¶
Basitin Soldier 1: (in Basitin) And did you see that statue General Alaric made?!
Basitin Soldier 2: (in Basitin) Actually‚Ä¶ I think Alaric‚Äôs always been like that. But I know what you mean. I‚Äôve noticed it too.Basitin Soldier 2: I mean, attacking someone from behind‚Ä¶ It just doesn‚Äôt feel right.
Basitin Soldier 1: I also heard something from the inner guards‚Ä¶ They say the king is sick with an unknown illness. And that the whole reason for the tower being built in the first place is to keep the king alive!
Basitin Soldier 2: Hey, don‚Äôt speak so loudly about that!
General Alabaster: Eavesdropping, I see. How like you‚Ä¶
Keith: General, how‚Ä¶ when did you‚Äî?
General Alabaster: And as indecent as ever. I‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre out here fooling around instead of following orders‚Ä¶ Considering how little time you have left.
Keith: W-What are you talking about? I have time. I‚Ä¶ I have until tomorrow‚Äî
General Alabaster: Plans have changed.
General Alabaster: Knowing how‚Ä¶ important this trial is, I‚Äôve spoken with the king and had your trial personally moved up to tonight. Your orders must still be carried out before the trial begins, however. Your time limit is now one hour.
Keith: W-what?! One hour?
General Alabaster: Once you‚Äôve completed your orders, you must light a candle in the window to indicate you‚Äî
Keith: That‚Äôs unfair!
General Alabaster: No! You returning from banishment is what‚Äôs unfair! It‚Äôs a mockery of our laws and our judicial system. You will do as you are ordered to do! You have one hour!Mike: Well, happy?
Evals: Yes, very! Um‚Ä¶ now, turn around!
Mike: Hey, that wasn‚Äôt part of the deal! All you asked for was a peek, an‚Äô that‚Äôs what you got!
Evals: Oooh, okay‚Ä¶
Evals: But I sure hope no one informs a certain human that his fox slave has become a vixen‚Ä¶
Mike: Erk!
Mike: Okay, okay! You‚Äôre a real dog, you know?
Evals: Snerk!
Mike: Huh?
Mike: What?
Evals: Mike, have you seen yourself from behind? Heh‚Ä¶
Mike: What are you‚Äî?
Evals: You‚Äôve got a heart on your butt!
Mike: H-hey!! That‚Äôs not my fur pattern!
Mike: Arg, that Basitin is going to pay!! My gender is one thing, but my fur‚Ä¶ My fur pattern is personal!Natani: What took you so long, Keith?
Keith: Oh, it was‚Ä¶ nothing‚Ä¶
Keith: Here‚Ä¶
Natani: oh, thanks‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs wrong? Your ears are all‚Ä¶ droopy.
Keith: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fine.
Keith: ‚Ä¶..
Natani: ‚Ä¶So Keith. That girl you came in with‚Ä¶ she was your ex-fianc√©e, right?
Keith: Huh? Oh, yeah, a long time ago‚Ä¶
Natani: I see‚Ä¶
Natani: Do‚Ä¶ do you still have feelings for her?
Keith: ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶
Keith: (thoughts) Why is she asking me this? And why am I just sitting here? I‚Äôm running out of time‚Ä¶Natani: (thoughts) Come on, Natani‚Ä¶ Just tell him you have feelings for him, before it‚Äôs too late.
Natani: (thoughts) No! I can‚Äôt, because I don‚Äôt! And even if I did have any so called ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù, it wouldn‚Äôt matter! I. Am. A. Male!
Natani: (thoughts) But‚Ä¶ I can at least admit I like him‚Ä¶ as a friend. That would be okay, right?
Natani: Keith‚Ä¶ I want to tell you that‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶that I appreciate you putting up with me.
Natani: I know my personality is kind of‚Ä¶ complicated. Because of it, I haven‚Äôt really had many friends.
Natani: Hardly any, actually. And I suppose you‚Äôre the best I‚Äôd had‚Ä¶
Natani: So‚Ä¶ what I‚Äôm trying to say is‚Ä¶ er, thanks, I guess.
Keith: Eeerrgh!
Natani: Eh?Keith: Graaaah!
Natani: Ah?!
Natani: K-Keith, what are you d ‚Äî ack!
Natani: G-get‚Ä¶ off of me!
Keith: Ah!
Natani: What‚Äôs wrong with you?!
Natani: I trusted you, Keith!
Natani: (thoughts) I was fooling myself thinking I could care about anyone! ‚Ä¶fooling myself thinking anyone could care about me‚Ä¶Natani: !
Keith: This is your fault.Keith: All my life, all I‚Äôve ever wanted was to come home. I wanted to be with my people‚Ä¶ my friends‚Ä¶ and I came so close‚Ä¶
Keith: But now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to lose it all‚Ä¶ because of you!
Natani: What?!
Keith: I thought I could just let myself do it‚Ä¶ We Basitins are biologically predispositioned to follow orders. The urge is‚Ä¶ overpowering.
Natani: What are you talking about?
Keith: It would have been the easy way‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Keith: I won‚Äôt!Keith: Aaargh!
Keith: Ugh‚Ä¶
Natani: Alright, you‚Äôd better explain what‚Äôs going on real quick, Keith.
Natani: Why did you try to kill me, and then turn around and try to kill yourself?
Keith: ‚Ä¶It‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt even matter anymore. I‚Äôve run out of time. I‚Äôve failed‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not a Basitin. You‚Ä¶ you wouldn‚Äôt understand.
Natani: Well you‚Äôd better try. That was an immobilizing spell. You‚Äôre not moving until I get some answers. I want you to tell me everything.Basitin Soldier 1: Sir, the hour has passed, yet there is no signal from Kaiser.
General Alabaster: So, he has failed‚Ä¶ as I had forseen he would. Good‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Burn the tavern down.
Basitin Soldier 1: G-General?! That is our‚Ä¶ own tavern!
Basitin Soldier 1: There are our own people in there. And Kaiser still needs to stand trial‚Äî
General Alabaster: Don‚Äôt you dare talk back to me!
General Alabaster: I said burn it down, now!
Basitin Soldier 2: Y-yes, Sir!
Basitin Soldier 3: Y-yes, Sir!
Basitin Soldier 1: Yes, sir‚Ä¶ urgh‚Ä¶
General Alabaster: Keith will pay for killing Cornelius yet!Nickolai: Are you sure it‚Äôs safe leaving him out in the open like this, Randal?
Randal: Oh, not to worry. He‚Äôs essentially harmless. That platform he‚Äôs lying on is one of my own invention. It creates an effect I call a mana sink.
Randal: You are familiar, of course, with the basic fundamentals of magic and how our Towers function.
Randal: Mana gathered in large enough quantities tend to crystalize.
Randal: Our towers are basically storage batteries. Templar work to draw mana into the towers, where it joins with the existing crystals to grow larger.
Randal: Then the mana energy from the crystals can be used by those linked to the tower.
Randal: In essence, Towers provide a store of energy vastly greater than any single mage could retain on his own.
Randal: The platform is linked directly to the tower and its draw of mana energies. This creates a constant force that siphons mana from anyone standing upon it.
Randal: Without mana, there is no magic. And without magic, Trace is an ordinary man.Narration: One explanation later‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs about it, I guess.
Natani: (thoughts) Keith‚Ä¶ he‚Ä¶ he gave up everything to save me! He had the chance to get back all he lost as a child, but he chose my life instead‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) And risked losing it all‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) If I was given the chance to get back my village and all my friends I lost as a child‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶would I have been willing to do the same as keith, and give it all away to save his life?
Natani: (thoughts) I don‚Äôt know if I could, but Keith‚Ä¶ he did. He cared about my life that much‚Ä¶
Keith: Natani? I told you everything‚Ä¶ why are you staring at me like that? I still have to report my failure at my trial.
Keith: Can you let me go now?
Natani: ‚Ä¶
Natani: No. Since you can‚Äôt move, there‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always wanted to do to you‚Ä¶
Keith: W-what?!
Keith: W-wait, stop! Don‚Äôt touch me there!
Keith: Those are sensitive!
Natani: They‚Äôre so soft!Keith: Enough, already! Why are you acting so strange all of the sudden?
Natani: I-I‚Äôm not really sure‚Ä¶ I should still be furious at you for attacking me, but‚Ä¶ you risked your life to save mine. ‚Ä¶Keith, I think there is something that‚Ä¶
Natani: that I have to admit to you‚Ä¶ and to myself, before it‚Äôs too late‚Ä¶
Natani: Even though I know you‚Äôre a guy‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt help feeling this‚Ä¶
Natani: Keith‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶
Laura: FIRE!
Laura: Keith! The tavern‚Äôs on fire! We have to get out!
Natani: Oh, gods! We can‚Äôt be seen like this!
Keith: L-let‚Äôs not panic! The door is locked, remember?
Laura: It‚Äôs locked!
Kat: Some weird guy just gave me the master key! Can this help?
Keith: SIGH‚Ä¶
Keith: Alright, let‚Äôs panic‚Ä¶Laura: Woah!
Natani: Stay Out!
[ULTRA LOCK SPELL!]
Natani: I‚Äôm not letting this happen to me again! I am sick and tired of people walking in on me, interrupting me‚Ä¶
Natani: ‚Ä¶or otherwise wrecking my life! I‚Äôm supposed to be a bloody assassin, for God‚Äôs sake!
Natani: Keith!
Keith: Y-yes, Ma‚Äôam.. er, I mean, Sir!
Natani: I‚Äôm going to unparalyze you now, so get up and get dressed. And don‚Äôt you dare try to kill me, or yourself, or anyone else until we get out of this mess, you hear me?
Natani: And one last thing!
Keith: Y-yes?
Keith: Mmph?!
Natani: Yeah, so‚Ä¶ there! Okay? I just wanted to get that off my chest. Don‚Äôt look too much into it!
Natani: Now get up! I‚Äôm getting us out of here!
Keith: ‚Ä¶Mike: Well, I hope you‚Äôre satisfied.
Evals: Hee hee, I appreciate it.
Evals: But seriously, I meant what I said. I will help you how I can. You know, you really don‚Äôt look all that different from when you were a guy. I bet with a little work, we could get you looking like a guy again in no time!
Evals: And then maybe later we can go and confront that Basitin together!
Evals: Whadaya say, Buddy?
Evals: Mike? Huh, he must have been exhausted‚Ä¶
Evals: Well, I guess I might as well let him be for now. I‚Äôll bug him lat‚Äî eh?
Evals: Hey, Mike! Leggo! You‚Äôve got my tail!
Evals: HMMM‚Ä¶
Evals: We-e-ell‚Ä¶ I could just risk waking him up to get my tail loose‚Ä¶
Evals: (thoughts) But‚Ä¶ that would be rude!Nickolai: As reassuring as your Tower is‚Ä¶
Nickolai: I have heard many rumors of the destructive nature of Trace‚Äôs power.
Nickolai: You‚Äôll understand when I say I look forward to you Templar leaving my island as soon as possible. No offense.
Randal: I understand. We shall depart as soon as the storms die down. Our ship is being prepared to contain Trace at this very moment.
Randal: But you have nothing to be concerned about.
Randal: I am quite confident in my ability to contain Trace‚Äôs power, if necessary. Your castle and people are in no danger.
Randal: As the Master Architect, I can guarantee you:
Randal: My technology is infallible.Natani: Alright, is everybody here? Where‚Äôs the humans?
Eric: Present! Is it just me, or are all the exits sealed off?
Flora: I‚Äôm here, but I can‚Äôt find Trace! And the whole first floor is on fire!
Natani: Trace isn‚Äôt in the tavern! I‚Äôll explain later, but right now I need to concentrate. I‚Äôve never done this many people before!
Flora: Done what? Wait a minute!
Flora: What are you doi‚Äì!Eric: Oh. We‚Äôre back at my ship! Fascinating!
Natani: I set a waypoint on the ship in case anything happened on the island.
Eric: So what may I ask did happen back there?
Flora: And Trace is still missing! Where is he, Natani?
Natani: ‚Ä¶
Natani: I think Keith should be the one to answer those.
Flora: ‚Ä¶Keith?Keith: ‚Ä¶And that‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶ Trace is probably at the tower now. They‚Äôre preparing to take him back to human territory, so they can attempt to restore his memory.
Kat: Oh, no‚Ä¶
Flora: Keith‚Ä¶ you betrayed us‚Ä¶
Keith: Yes, Flora, I‚Äî
Flora: How could you, Keith? I know you don‚Äôt think very highly of Keidran, but you were Trace‚Äôs best friend!
Flora: Didn‚Äôt our travels together mean anything to you?
Natani: Flora, please!
Natani: What Keith did was wrong, but he‚Äôs trying to make things right now!
Flora: Make things right?! He sold us out!
Flora: Why are you defending him, he tried to kill you! How can you trust him after that?
Keith: I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want any of this‚Ä¶ I just wanted to go home.Eric: (thoughts) A Tower on the island?
Eric: (thoughts) Why would the Templar do that? Doesn‚Äôt sound like the Templar I knew‚Ä¶
Eric: (thoughts) But I feel like I‚Äôve heard this before‚Ä¶
Eric: (thoughts) Basitins‚Ä¶ Magic‚Ä¶
Eric: Roderick, is that a Basitin?
Roderick: Oh, yeah, that‚Äôs Vehra, Master Templar‚Äôs personal pet.
Eric: Where can I get one of those? I‚Äôve never heard of a Basitin slave.
Roderick: She‚Äôs the only one that I know of. She was a failed experiment. The Master Mage found some way to give Basitins the ability to wield magic.
Roderick: But apparently after a while forcing magic makes ‚Äòem go soft in the head. She used to be pretty skilled, but now she can hardly speak in full sentences.
Eric: (thoughts) This is all just a ruse‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre fooling the Basitins into lobotomizing themselves.
Eric: (thoughts) That sounds exactly like the Templar I knew.Mike: ?
[Merry Christmas! Get lucky!]Keith: The tower‚Äôs a trap?!
Eric: Yes! Using magic will slowly drive your people insane.
Keith: I knew it!
Keith: I knew those Templar were up to no good!
Laura: Keith! You have to warn them!
Keith: They won‚Äôt listen to me! Until my trial, I‚Äôm still considered an outsider! Even if I do warn them, Basitin bureaucracy will prevent them from doing anything about it until it‚Äôs too late‚Ä¶
Group Member: But we have to do something!
Flora: And we still need to save Trace!
Group Member: What can we do, though‚Ä¶?
Eric: Keith! You said that the Tower was incomplete, right? Was there any openings left in the outer wall?
Keith: Wha-? Well‚Ä¶ yes. Last time I saw it, there was a hole still left in the side. Why?
Eric: It‚Äôs risky, but‚Ä¶
Eric: Keith, if you can get us in there‚Ä¶ I think I know how we can take down the Tower and save Trace at the same time!Eric: Completed Towers are very resilient to attack,
Eric: because its core is protected by a strong crystalline barrier.
Eric: However, if the Tower wall is still incomplete, the core will be exposed.
Eric: With enough force, a strike to the core will begin a catastrophic chain-reaction, causing the crystals to release all their mana energy at the same time.
Eric: This will take out the Tower‚Ä¶ and likely half the castle with it. That‚Äôll give us the distraction we need to escape.
Eric: So, if ‚Äî and this is a big if ‚Äî we can get into the castle courtyard, we then grab Trace, snipe the Tower, and run for our lives.
Eric: Natani, you‚Äôre our only magic user. Do you think you can hit the Tower with a magicked arrow?
Natani: I don‚Äôt know how I feel about saving a human, but he‚Äôs better out of Templar hands. I‚Äôve only got one shot, but if you can get me up to it, I can take it out!
Laura: A-actually, I-I can‚Äî
Eric: Alright, let me get a map‚Ä¶
Laura: O-oh, okay‚Ä¶Eric: There are three bridges leading up to the castle. A central bridge, and two lesser bridges to the north and south.
Eric: Reaching the bridges shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. It‚Äôs after curfew, and I don‚Äôt hear any alarms going off. So they probably don‚Äôt know we escaped the fire, yet.
Eric: But getting across those bridges will be a lot harder without being detected. The castle side will be well defended.
Kat: Ah!
Keith: You guys take the north and south bridges. They are out of the way and easier to cross.
Keith: I will take the central bridge alone and draw their attention away.
Laura: Keith! No, you can‚Äôt go by yourself!
Keith: I have to‚Ä¶ even if destroying the tower means saving my people, I will still be marked as a traitor for aiding you. I must face them alone, but at least I can serve as a distraction.Eric: Kat, I want you to go get Mike and Evals and prep the ship.
Kat: What? No! I‚Äôm coming with you!
Eric: Out of the question!
Kat: Why?
Eric: It‚Äôs dangerous enough as it is, and the less people out there the better! Now do as I say and help prepare the ship!
Eric: If you don‚Äôt see a flash of light from the tower in an hour, I want you to leave.
Flora: Keith, before you go‚Ä¶ Natani explained to me what you did for us.
Flora: He explained to me about you Basitin and orders‚Ä¶ Although I‚Äôm still not sure if I understand‚Ä¶ or forgive you yet for what you let happen to Trace‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry for hitting you.
Keith: Well, it doesn‚Äôt matter now. All that matters is stopping the Templar and getting Trace back.
Keith: So let‚Äôs get this over with. I‚Äôm going out now, you guys follow when the coast is clear.Laura: E-excuse me‚Ä¶
Laura: I‚Äî I just wanted to ask‚Ä¶ You are a human‚Ä¶
Laura: So why do you fight y-your own kind?
Eric: Oh, My Dear, we humans are not so different from you Keidran. We have both good and bad. Many of us do not agree with the Templars.
Laura: S-still! Risking your own life t-to save the Basitins‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been told humans were heartless, b-but you‚Äôre nothing like I expected.
Laura: You‚Äôre v-very brave.
Eric: How can I not be? I can‚Äôt just stand idle while the Templar perform genocide!
Eric: What the Templar are doing is evil!
Eric: And I must do everything in my power to fight for what I consider to be right!
Laura: WOW!
Laura: So noble!
Eric: Because no Basitins means no Basitin women! And I can‚Äôt let that happen!Nickolai: I‚Äôm sorry, Brother‚Ä¶
Nickolai: This is the end.Laura: ‚Ä¶what‚Äôs that?
Eric: Wha-? Well, uh, this just makes light out of mana. Why are you here?
Eric: I thought you were going to stay on the ship?
Laura: I - I decided to come with you. I‚Äôm not going to abandon Keith a-again. If he‚Äôs doing this, then I will a-as well. I - I also owe the Basitin people a lot, f-for their hospitality. I must help anyway I can.
Eric: But this is very dangerous!
Eric: You‚Äôre better off on the ship where it‚Äôs safe!
General Alabaster: You should listen to the human, Mongrel.
General Alabaster: Not that it will make any difference now.Flora: There it is, the bridge! And the cost is clear‚Ä¶
Musclehead General: Not so fast, Fiends!
Musclehead General: You might as well give yourselves up now, for you have no chance of defeating me!
Natani: Aw crap, it‚Äôs the Musclehead General!
Musclehead General: Geh‚Ä¶ Musclehead General?!Mike: ?
Fox Woman: ‚ô™
Fox Woman: ‚ô•Mike: AAAAAHHH!
Evals: YAAAAHHH!
Kat: Hey, Guys, Eric wants you to‚Ä¶ er‚Ä¶
Mike: KYAAAAAAHHH
Evals: KYAAAAAAHHH
Kat: OH MY‚Ä¶Flora: Nya‚Ä¶ Natani‚Ä¶
Musclehead General: Armed? Fah! What need do I have for weapons?
Musclehead General: It would be shameful just to scuff this armor in battle to the likes of villains such as you!
Musclehead General: No‚Ä¶
Musclehead General: My body is the only weapon I need to achieve victory!!
Natani: ‚Ä¶are all Basitins insane by nature?
Flora: ‚Ä¶maybe‚Ä¶
Natani: At least he isn‚Äôt very bright! Eat steel, Musclehead!
Natani: ‚Ä¶oh crud‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre screwed.Eric: This doesn‚Äôt look good. You better stay back, Laura‚Ä¶
Eric: ‚Ä¶Laura? What the‚Ä¶?
General Alabaster: Looks like the vixen has abandoned you. Typical Keidran cowardice. Though in this case, she may have been wise to do so.
General Alabaster: I could stop you right now, but I am old, and do not have as much fight in me as I once did. And I know you are no warrior either.
General Alabaster: We are both men of scholar, so I have a proposition for you.
General Alabaster: If you are able to tell me any common knowledge I do not already know, I will allow you to pass.
General Alabaster: But if you cannot, you shall surrender, and tell me everything your friends are planning.
Eric: I suppose I don‚Äôt have much of a choice‚Ä¶ fine, a battle of minds it is.Keith: So you see! The Templar set you up! It‚Äôs slowly driving you insane.
Nickolai: ‚Ä¶
Nickolai: ‚Ä¶I see‚Ä¶ I had my suspicions that the Templar might have been trying something‚Ä¶
Keith: So now you see why I have to stop them!
Keith: You have to let me through‚Äî
Nickolai: No!
Keith: What? I told you everything! The Humans, The Templar‚Ä¶ you know now‚Ä¶ Nick, you should be helping me‚Ä¶
Nickolai: You have no right to call me that, Keith! I‚Äôm not broken like you. I cannot disregard the laws that have built our society.
Nickolai: It‚Äôs for the courts to decide what should be done with the humans. As for me, I must do as ordered by the king ‚Äî and my orders are to stop you and your friends here.
Nickolai: I do what‚Äôs commanded, even if I feel it‚Äôs wrong. That is what it means to be a Basitin.Natani: RAAAWWWR!
Natani: WHINE‚Ä¶Keith: I won‚Äôt back down, Alaric.
Keith: I must do what I know is right‚Ä¶ Even if it means fighting the ones I‚Äôm trying to save.
Nickolai: ‚Ä¶very well, Keith.
Nickolai: En garde!!Keith: Ah!
Nickolai: YAAAAHH!Eric: OK
Eric: The capital of the Wolven Territories is‚Äî
General Alabaster: ‚ÄîKarne, population 36,000. You‚Äôll have to do better than that.
Eric: The first Great War ended‚Äî
General Alabaster: ‚Äîon March 1st of the second century, 181 CE‚Ä¶ If you could call that pathetic skirmish between you and the Keidran a ‚Äòwar‚Äô.
Eric: ‚Ä¶erm‚Ä¶ my middle name‚Äî
General Alabaster: ‚ÄîIs Adrian; after your grandfather.
Eric: !
General Alabaster: But that‚Äôs not a general knowledge question, is it?
General Alabaster: Are you prepared to surrender your friends yet?Templar 1: Hey‚Ä¶ what is that?
Templar 1: What‚Äôs wrong with the core?
Templar 2: I dunno‚Ä¶
Templar 3: The mana sink on the ship is done.
Randal: Very good.
Randal: Ah?!
Randal: Oh‚Ä¶
Randal: That‚Äôs bad‚Ä¶Musclehead General: Looks like it‚Äôs just you now.
Flora: S-stay back! I‚Äôm warning you‚Ä¶ M-my claws are sharp!
Flora: And‚Ä¶ now they‚Äôre not‚Ä¶
Flora: Ehehe~
Musclehead General: You two are probably lucky it was me you faced and not the other two.
Musclehead General: You‚Äôd better hope your friends are having more luck than you. For all our sakes.Musclehead General: There! Don‚Äôt worry. The courts will probably just have you two deported.
Musclehead General: Our laws are not cruel. Tough but fair is the Basitin way!
Sirus (Basitin): Those two should be saving Trace.
Musclehead General: !
Musclehead General: Eh? Who are you? What do you know about it‚Äî
Musclehead General: Wait‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs something strange about you‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not Basitin‚Ä¶ What are you?
Sirus (Basitin): ‚ô™‚ô´Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
General Alabaster: Well, is that all you‚Äôve got, Boy?
Eric: (thoughts) Ugh‚Ä¶ this is hopeless‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt outwit him!
Kat: Don‚Äôt give up, Master!
Eric: Kathrin? I told you to stay on the boat!
Kat: I just couldn‚Äôt! I had to see that you were okay!
Kat: Come on, Eric! There must be something you know that the old goat doesn‚Äôt! Think! You‚Äôre the smartest person that I know!
Eric: Ahah!
Eric: There is one thing!
General Alabaster: Ah?!
Eric: It‚Äôs a subject I consider myself to be an expert on!Eric: OK‚Ä¶
Eric: This is something any Keidran breeder would know!
Eric: During what time is a Keidran capable of having a child?
General Alabaster: Huh?
General Alabaster: PFFF‚Ä¶ HA! HA! HA!
General Alabaster: Is that all? Surely you could have thought up something more perverse than that? What, did you think an old Basitin like me would know nothing about mating?
Eric: So you know‚Ä¶?
General Alabaster: Naturally! Our kind may not particularly care for the subject, but we aren‚Äôt ignorant of it. Conception happens during estrus, of course!
Eric: Actually‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre wrong.
General Alabaster: Of course I a‚Äî er, wait, what?
Eric: I figured you‚Äôd think I was trying to stump you with a perverse question. So instead, I came up with a trick question!
Eric: You see, unlike Basitin, Keidran are only fertile a week after they‚Äôve been in heat. It works that way because Keidran, unlike Basitin, use sex to get to know one another. If they are happy together, they will continue to be together even after their cycle has ended. It‚Äôs common knowledge‚Ä¶
Kat: Even I knew the answer!
Kat: ‚ô•
General Alabaster: (thoughts) No! I-It can‚Äôt be! How could I not know?!Keith: Ugh‚Ä¶
Nickolai: Keith, it‚Äôs over. Surrender before it‚Äôs too late.
Nickolai: I don‚Äôt want to kill you.
Keith: Then‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ You have free will‚Ä¶ you have a choice!
Nickolai: I have made my choice, Keith. I chose to stay on the path of righteousness‚Ä¶ You chose the path of rebellion. There‚Äôs no turning back now, Brother.
Keith: ‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶ I guess you‚Äôre right, Alaric‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve‚Ä¶ made our decisions‚Ä¶
Keith: Now we‚Ä¶ erg‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶have to live with it!
Nickolai: Ah?!Nickolai: (thoughts) No, the castle‚Ä¶ it was a trick!
Nickolai: (thoughts) I‚Äôm standing on the section of the bridge I damaged‚Ä¶! If I keep backing up, I‚Äôll lose him!
Keith: Alaric, no!
Nickolai: I won‚Äôt let you get away!Nickolai: ‚Ä¶hah! I can‚Äôt believe I made that!
Nickolai: Ah?!
Keith: Alaric!
Nickolai: Keith?Nickolai: You‚Ä¶ saved me. You‚Äôve‚Ä¶ decided to go back to our side!
Keith: No, I haven‚Äôt! Don‚Äôt you get it yet, Alaric? It‚Äôs not about sides.
Keith: Maybe I have been away from home for too long now, but I don‚Äôt care about sides and politics anymore. I just don‚Äôt want to see my friends hurt. Not Natani, not Trace, and not even you!
Nickolai: Me?
Nickolai: ‚Ä¶m-maybe you‚Äôre right. Maybe‚Ä¶ the laws can be‚Ä¶ wrong?
Keith: Aurgh!
General Alabaster: Keith?!
Keith: I can‚Äôt pull you up‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ hold on‚Ä¶Keith: Augh! Alaric, hurry‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt hold on‚Ä¶
Nickolai: Just don‚Äôt let go‚Ä¶! Keith, there‚Äôs things I haven‚Äôt told you‚Ä¶ things I couldn‚Äôt work up the nerve to tell you‚Ä¶
Nickolai: Everything I did was for you, Keith‚Ä¶
Nickolai: Even my eye‚Ä¶ I wanted you to be proud of me.
Nickolai: Keith‚Ä¶!
Keith: No!!
Keith: Alaric!!
Keith: Nick‚Ä¶Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Natani: Flora, wake up.
Natani: You alright? We need to go.
Flora: Natani?
Flora: Oh, gods‚Ä¶ Natani? D-did you do‚Ä¶?
Natani: No. I woke up just before you. He was like this.
Natani: ‚Ä¶but whoever did do it was much more powerful than me.
Flora: T-this is terrible‚Ä¶ Why would someone do something like this? Even in order to help us‚Ä¶
Flora: He didn‚Äôt deserve to die‚Ä¶ not like this‚Ä¶
Natani: Hey! We don‚Äôt have time for that! We have our own lives to worry about!
Natani: We‚Äôve got to get to the others!Natani: Wait here, Flora.
Natani: I‚Äôll scout ahead. As an assassin, stealth and discretion are my specialty.
Madelyn: (in Basitin) Hey, who are you?
Natani: Damn it!
Madelyn: (in Basitin) It‚Äôs past curfew, and this is a restricted area!
Madelyn: (in Basitin) Oh, wait. You‚Äôre the wolf I talked to before.
Madelyn: Remember me, from yesterday? I guess‚Ä¶ you are here to save the human, yes?
Natani: Erm‚Ä¶ how would you know that?
Madelyn: I‚Äôve been stalking you.
Natani: Oh‚Ä¶ what?!
Madelyn: Also, as a lieutenant, I know what‚Äôs happening around the castle. I would like to help you.
Natani: ‚Ä¶why?
Madelyn: I‚Ä¶ have reasons. But I need a favor first.
Madelyn: I‚Äôll look the other way‚Ä¶ if you give Keith this note here.Flora: Wow, that was a close one, wasn‚Äôt‚Äî Hey! Don‚Äôt open that! It‚Äôs not yours!
Natani: Hrmph‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt read it anyway.
Natani: It‚Äôs all in what I assume is Basitin‚Ä¶ though with a‚Ä¶ disturbing number of hearts drawn on it‚Ä¶
Natani: Well, she‚Äôs gone now. Let‚Äôs go.
Flora: Oh! Natani!
Flora: You almost dropped the note! We don‚Äôt want Keith to miss out reading this! He always seems unhappy, maybe settling down with a nice Basitin girl will do him good.
Flora: Don‚Äôt you think?
Natani: Oh, sure‚Ä¶ that would be‚Ä¶
Natani: ‚Ä¶great‚Ä¶Natani: Oh, hey! It‚Äôs you guys!
Eric: Ah, good, you made it! We got held up by a general.
Kat: But Eric outsmarted him!
Natani: We ran into a general too.
Natani: Long story, though. Where‚Äôs Keith?
Laura: Gasp!
Laura: T-there he is!
Laura: He looks hurt!
Laura: K-Kei‚Äì!
Natani: Keith!Natani: Er‚Ä¶
Natani: Oh, whatever. I‚Äôll deal with the gay rumors later. Keith, can you hear me?
Keith: Natani‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I killed him‚Ä¶
Keith: I‚Äôve killed them all‚Ä¶ my mom, my dad‚Ä¶ my best friend‚Ä¶
Keith: They‚Äôre all dead‚Ä¶ dead because of me.
Natani: Don‚Äôt talk like that. I remember what you said at the graveyard.
Natani: It wasn‚Äôt your fault‚Ä¶
Flora: Natani, is there anything you can do for him?
Natani: Even if I could spare the magic, healing wounds like this is beyond me.
Natani: We don‚Äôt have time enough anyway. I‚Äôll carry him.Flora: That must be it! ‚ÄúThe huge door‚Äù!
Flora: Trace is on the other side!
Basitin Soldier: Halt!
Basitin Soldier: Don‚Äôt move, villains!
General Alabaster: Ah hah‚Ä¶ thank you very much for bringing me the rest of your cohorts, Eric.General Alabaster: You whelps have made a lot of trouble tonight.
General Alabaster: But now it‚Äôs time for me to finish what I began at the tavern.
King Adelaide: And what exactly was that, General?
General Alabaster: Your Majesty!
General Alabaster: I‚Ä¶ thought you were still bed-ridden. You shouldn‚Äôt be out here‚Ä¶ in this rain‚Äî
King Adelaide: I am not yet too weak to stand with my men when the time calls for it.
Flora: Woah, that‚Äôs a‚Ä¶ big Basitin. But‚Ä¶ I thought they had a king?
Eric: They do‚Ä¶
Eric: ‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs her, King Adelaide.King Adelaide: I‚Äôve been hearing disturbing reports of your activities, General. Killing a fellow soldier‚Ä¶ Burning down a Basitin tavern‚Ä¶ Manipulating a legal trial‚Ä¶ What is making you act in such a way?
Eric: Your Majesty! If I may‚Ä¶
Eric: The General‚Äôs judgement is being impaired by the magic.
Eric: Basitin minds weren‚Äôt meant to wield magical energy. It‚Äôs been corrupting him, just as it will to all Basitin‚Äî
General Alabaster: Lies! Nothing but lies! He‚Äôs working with the Keidran; trying to keep the magic to themselves! My mind has not been changed! My mind has never been clearer; my body never stronger!
King Adelaide: I‚Äôm averse to taking the word of an intruder‚Ä¶ But I cannot ignore this unnatural behavior.King Adelaide: Until I can learn more about what‚Äôs going on, I want these intruders detained and taken to the cells.
General Alabaster: What? No!
General Alabaster: They are too dangerous! We need to kill them now!
King Adelaide: No, I said detained! That‚Äôs an order!
King Adelaide: And I want you confined to your quarters as well.
King Adelaide: Is that clear, General?
General Alabaster: An order‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
General Alabaster: I‚Ä¶ yes‚Ä¶ I mean, no‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
General Alabaster: I‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶
Kat: Aaaah!
Flora: AAAAAAAUGH!Randal: Keep focus, children!
Randal: We must keep up that field until I finish the sedative.
Templar: S-Sir, he‚Äôs moving!
Randal: Just continue holding him! He won‚Äôt regain full consciousness if you maintain suppression.
Randal: It is imperative we get Trace back to Human territory and restore his memories.
Randal: We must find out what he discovered before he was taken.
Randal: There, finished!
Templar: Aaaaaah!Randal: Trace!
Trace: STOP HURTING FLORA!King Adelaide: General, I gave you a direct order to stop!
General Alabaster: No! Keith killed Cornelius. He and all his friends deserve to die!
Natani: Nngh!
Keith: Natani‚Ä¶
King Adelaide: You leave me no choice!
King Adelaide: Guards-!
King Adelaide: Ah?!
General Alabaster: ‚Ä¶w-what now?!Flora: Tra‚Ä¶ Trace!
Trace: Flora?
Trace: You, Basitin! Are you the one harming Flora?Trace: (in Human) No matter‚Ä¶
Trace: (in Human) I‚Äôll kill you all and sort it out later.
Basitin Soldier 1: Defend the king!
Basitin Soldier 2: Ah!
Eric: Natani, the tower is feeding his powers!
Eric: And there‚Äôs the vulnerability!
Natani: Erg, I see it‚Ä¶ Fat lot of good it does us, though.
Natani: We‚Äôve only got one shot and no opening.
King Adelaide: Keidran, are you saying the tower‚Äôs causing this madness, and you can stop it?
Natani: Yes, I could‚Ä¶
King Adelaide: Very well! I‚Äôll give you your opening!King Adelaide: AAAAAAH!
King Adelaide: Ah!
Trace: Ironic‚Ä¶ in death your men serve me.Eric: It‚Äôs working‚Ä¶ the debris is falling!
Eric: Natani, you need to take the shot!
Natani: I know, just a moment‚Ä¶
Natani: You‚Äôd better be right about this, Human! Alright, Arrow, I‚Äôve given you everything I‚Äôve got‚Ä¶ now‚Ä¶
Natani: Just‚Ä¶ hit it!Natani: No!
General Alabaster: Stay back! This tower is mine!
General Alabaster: I won‚Äôt let you sabotage all that I have worked for!
Natani: That was our only shot‚Ä¶
Natani: What do we do now?Laura: Natani, I t-think you have another chance. You‚Ä¶ you might be able to use my locket as a s-source of mana.
Natani: What? Why didn‚Äôt you tell me that before?
Laura: I-I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ very important to me. I.. I was hoping you wouldn‚Äôt have to use it.
Natani: Well with the way things are going now, this won‚Äôt do us much good, anyway.
Natani: I‚Äôll never get a clear shot so long as that idiot‚Äôs pinning us down!
Natani: Got anything else that might‚Äî
Natani: Laura? ‚Ä¶where did she go?Natani: (thoughts) Laura! What is she doing?!
Laura: (thoughts) If I can take his attention away‚Ä¶ just for a few seconds‚Ä¶
Laura: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶please, don‚Äôt let it hurt‚Ä¶
Laura: Ah‚Ä¶!
Laura: Eh?
General Alabaster: What?!General Alabaster: The Templar should have put you down when they had the chance.
General Alabaster: You humans are nothing but trouble!
Trace: I won‚Äôt let you hurt Flora‚Ä¶ or‚Ä¶ the others!
General Alabaster: Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm afraid of you, Boy.
General Alabaster: You may have once been a skilled mage, but now you‚Äôre just a child with power beyond your control!
General Alabaster: I‚Äôll show you true magic-!
General Alabaster: Erk‚Ä¶!
General Alabaster: GAAACK!
Laura: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm hurting you!General Alabaster: I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ kill you‚Ä¶!
Laura: AAAAAH!!
Eric: Natani, now‚Äôs our chance, do it!
Natani: Right!
Keith: No‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt!
Keith: Laura‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs too close to the tower‚Ä¶ she won‚Äôt be able to escape the blast.
Eric: Laura‚Äôs given us this chance, and it may be the only one we get! We have no other choice!
Eric: Natani, come on!
Natani: I‚Ä¶Natani: I‚Äôm sorry, Laura.
Natani: It was your choice.
Natani: And I‚Äôll make sure it wasn‚Äôt in vain!

Nickolai: If you‚Äôd looked at the crime, you‚Äôd have seen Keith couldn‚Äôt have done it! He wouldn‚Äôt have had the strength to beat his mother to death or stab his father!
Nickolai: And it was obvious his father was drunk at the ti‚Äî
General Alabaster: How dare you speak ill of Cornelius!
Nickolai: AAAAAAHHH!
General Alabaster: Cornelius Kaiser was a brilliant man‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶a better man than you or his bastard son could ever be.
General Alabaster: And that boy killed him!
General Alabaster: I won‚Äôt let you take this away from me‚Ä¶
Nickolai: Keith‚Ä¶Nickolai: I didn‚Äôt stand up to him‚Ä¶
Nickolai: I wasn‚Äôt strong enough back then.
Nickolai: But after that day, I set out to change things.
Nickolai: The old generals manipulated the system‚Ä¶ So I did as well!
Nickolai: ‚Ä¶I hope you‚Äôre still alive. I‚Äôve made on last scheme‚Ä¶ A practical joke on all those who were responsible for six years ago‚Ä¶
Nickolai: Keith‚Ä¶TwoKinds
Chapter Twelve
The Morning[No Keidran!]
Karen: I‚Äôm so bored!
Maren: Karen, stop it.
Maren: It‚Äôs been over a month. You need to get over this wanderlust of yours. We‚Äôre not adventurers. Our place is here in this inn.
Karen: But it‚Äôs so boring! It feels like we haven‚Äôt done anything in four years!
Karen: Didn‚Äôt you have fun chasing Trace around all the time?
Maren: Yeah, well, now it‚Äôs over. So get used to it already.
Karen: Augh‚Ä¶
Karen: Come on‚Ä¶ something‚Ä¶ anything exciting happen‚Ä¶
[No Keidran!]
[Tom‚Äôs Postal]
Tom: Wolves are attacking the village! They‚Äôre trying to kill everyone!
Karen: Hurray!
Tom: H‚Ä¶ hurray?!Tom: Ack! They‚Äôre here!
Tom: W-wait! Can‚Äôt we talk about this‚Äî?
Sythe: Die, Human!
Sythe: Alright, the rest of you are ne‚Äî
Sythe: Eh?
Sythe: Oh, no, not you guys again‚Ä¶
Karen: Oh, hey, Mr. Sythe!
Maren: Karen, get down!
Sythe: (thoughts) Damn it, why did it have to be them? The only Humans I actually know‚Ä¶
Sythe: From that night in the tavern‚Ä¶
Sythe: Look‚Ä¶ you guys should get out of here. The others won‚Äôt hesitate to kill you.
Maren: Huh?Red: I‚Äôve been meaning to ask you, Raine‚Ä¶
Raine: About wha‚Äî hey! What are you doing with those?
Red: These are the shackles we first found you in, right? Why do you keep them around?
Raine: Hey, wait, don‚Äôt‚Äî!
Red: It seems weird to still wear something from your time in slavery‚Ä¶
Red: Erg‚Ä¶ Damn those Keidran! It makes me sick to think that those animals enslave human beings. Those beasts‚Ä¶ I tell you, if I had my hands on one right now‚Ä¶!
Maren: Hey, guys! Get down here, we‚Äôve got a problem!
Red: Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs up.
Raine: O-ok, sure‚Ä¶Sythe: Would you guys hurry up? We don‚Äôt have all day!
Red: Grr‚Ä¶
Red: Maren, why are you even listening to this Keidran? I say we run these beasts through, starting with this one!
Sythe: Don‚Äôt be an idiot! You‚Äôre just one warrior and the rest of the town is lost. Your priority should be to get these women to safety!
Sythe: Be grateful I‚Äôm actually helping you escape!
Wolf: ‚ÄúHelping escape?‚Äù
Sythe: B-Boss!
Wolf: Sythe, I always knew you were a coward, but now I see you‚Äôre a traitor as well!
Sythe: N-no!! I‚Äôm not a traitor! I was just‚Ä¶ they‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶
Karen: Oh, can‚Äôt you tell by the ears? We‚Äôre family. Sythe‚Äôs my father!
Sythe: What?!
Wolf: F-father?!Wolf: Not only are you a traitor‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ mated with one of these hairless apes?!
[‚Üë INN]
Maren: Karen, why are you antagonizing the Keidran?
Karen: Because it‚Äôs fun‚Ä¶ And now Sythe can‚Äôt weasel out of coming with us!
Sythe: I-It‚Äôs a lie! I swear! She‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs five years older than me!
Wolf: Enough of this! Kill them all!
Raine: There‚Äôs no need for violence! We haven‚Äôt done anything to you! Please‚Ä¶
Raine: Let us go!
Raine: Oops‚Ä¶
Karen: Cool!
Wolf: What the-? Stop them!Maren: Urg‚Ä¶ jeez, Raine. How about a little warning next time?
Raine: Sorry!
Red: I didn‚Äôt know you knew magic!
Karen: Do it again!
Raine: I don‚Äôt! I mean, not really‚Ä¶ My mother was the Grand Templar before Trace, and I inherited magic from her.
Raine: But I never had any formal training. It usually happens by accident.
Maren: Uh, guys‚Ä¶
Wolf: Hey! They‚Äôre right over there!
Maren: We‚Äôre only ten meters away from where we just were‚Ä¶
Maren: Run!Wolf 1: Should we go after them?
Wolf 2: No. We still have orders to carry out. Mage, contact the others and tell them to send the assassin.
Wolf 1: They won‚Äôt get far‚Ä¶
Zen: Deserter?
Wolf 3: Yes, we just received news from the front. The traitor‚Äôs name is Sythe. Apparently, he eloped with a Human.
Wolf 3: Unfortunately, he‚Äôs also the nephew of someone important, so they want him returned alive if at all possible. Just make sure they‚Äôre all silenced one way or another.
Wolf 3: I hope you haven‚Äôt gotten rusty since your injury. ‚Ä¶Zen?
Wolf 3: Zen, are you listening to me?
Zen: Huh? Oh, right. No problem!
Zen: SIGH‚Ä¶
Zen: (thoughts) Natani, where are you? Why can‚Äôt I hear your thoughts‚Ä¶Natani: Nngh‚Ä¶
Natani: Hm?
Natani: Great‚Ä¶ where am I and how many people do I have to kill?Natani: (thoughts) I‚Äôve gotta get out of here.. augh! Damn it, I can barely move‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) How long was I out? Did any of the others see me like this?
Natani: Eh?
Natani: Oh, come on! Why cover my feet and nothing else?
Basitin Doctor: Oh, one of you has finally woken up! Your injuries were quite severe. I wasn‚Äôt sure if you‚Äôd survive.
Natani: So you were the one who-!
Natani: Huh?
Basitin Doctor: Is there something wrong, Miss?Basitin Doctor: Oh, the mask.
Basitin Doctor: It‚Äôs for privacy. Prevents‚Ä¶ temptation. Many Basitin would be unwilling to receive treatment if there was a chance of being exposed. Many would also be unwilling if it were public knowledge that they needed help at all.
Basitin Doctor: So, we hide our eyes and instead rely on our ears.
Natani: So‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt know who I am?
Basitin Doctor: Well, I can tell you‚Äôre a Keidran. And I‚Ä¶ noticed you were female once I began examining you.
Basitin Doctor: (in Basitin) My Lord! This man is horribly disfigured! I‚Ä¶
Basitin Doctor: (in Basitin) Oh‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Oh my‚Ä¶
Basitin Doctor: But beyond that, I don‚Äôt have information about your identity.
Natani: (thoughts) Phew‚Ä¶
Natani: And no one else has been in here?
Basitin Doctor: Not since they brought you in.
Basitin Doctor: ‚Ä¶It is refreshing to see a Keidran that values modesty. I‚Ä¶ did not think it was possible for your kind. I, um‚Ä¶ well, there‚Äôs more work to be done. I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd better go‚Ä¶Natani: Hey, wait! What about me? Am I a prisoner here or something?
Basitin Doctor: A prisoner? No‚Ä¶
Basitin Doctor: Or‚Ä¶ maybe? I‚Äôm not actually sure. I won‚Äôt stop you from leaving this room. But I suspect those guards stationed at the exits are there to keep you here.
Basitin Doctor: To be honest‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not really sure what‚Äôs going on.
Basitin Doctor: We haven‚Äôt been getting orders recently.
Basitin Doctor: With the king and her generals absent, the lieutenants have been fighting amongst themselves to determine who should take command. It‚Äôs dissolving into chaos‚Ä¶
Basitin Doctor: But for now it would probably be best for you to stay here.
Natani: Hmph, fat chance‚Ä¶
Basitin Doctor: Anyway, I should go. Oh, we‚Äôve set out some clothes for you on the table there.
Natani: Hm?
Natani: Erk!
Natani: This‚Ä¶ is a dress.Natani: Okay, I‚Äôm all dressed!
Natani: Hey, this isn‚Äôt so bad!
Natani: No, no, no! I can‚Äôt wear a dress! I won‚Äôt!
Basitin Doctor: W-well you can‚Äôt go around naked!
Basitin Doctor: This dress was the only thing we had on-hand that fit someone of your stature! It was made for Adelaide when she was younger.
Natani: What happened to the clothes I was in?
Basitin Doctor: Uh‚Ä¶ all the possessions from when you arrived were taken to the storeroom.
Basitin Doctor: It‚Äôs one floor down from here. Why do you ask?
Basitin Doctor: ‚Ä¶Miss?Flora: Please, I have to find Trace!
Basitin Doctor: Miss, I‚Äôm sorry. As I said before, we can‚Äôt allow you to go into other patients‚Äô rooms.
Flora: But you don‚Äôt understand! I don‚Äôt even know if he‚Äôs alive! I don‚Äôt know if any of my friends are okay! Please‚Ä¶
Basitin Doctor: Sigh‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ there are laws that make exceptions for family or couples‚Ä¶
Basitin Doctor: And there is only one room with a human in it; it must be his‚Ä¶ But I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôd allow Keidran to‚Ä¶
Basitin Doctor: Alright! I‚Äôll talk to the others and see what I can do.
Basitin Doctor: But I need to make sure you and the little one are all healthy first.
Flora: Mew? ‚ÄúLittle One‚Äù? Who is that?
Basitin Doctor: Well, your baby, of course!Flora: Baby?
Flora: Where? I don‚Äôt have a baby.
Basitin Doctor: Oh, I‚Äôm sorry. I thought you knew. I discovered you were pregnant while I was checking you.
Flora: P-pregnant?!
Flora: Hey, you must have the wrong person!
Flora: I‚Äôm not pregnant! It wouldn‚Äôt be possible, I‚Äôve only been with Trace.
Basitin Doctor: No, I am certain I can hear a second heartbeat within you. But you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs impossible with a Human‚Ä¶
Basitin Doctor: Well‚Ä¶ I suppose it‚Äôs not surprising that you don‚Äôt know the father. From what I‚Äôve heard about Keidran‚Ä¶
Basitin Doctor: It was probably some random Keidran you met along your travels‚Ä¶
Flora: What are you implying?!
Basitin Doctor: Ack! Mood swings!Natani: (thoughts) Good. No one in sight.
Natani: (thoughts) With my stealth skills, I should have no problem‚Äî
Zen: NATANI!!
Zen: (thoughts) Er, sorry‚Ä¶
Zen: (thoughts) What happened to you? You‚Äôve been blocking me out since yesterday. And then your mind was gone until now‚Ä¶
Zen: (thoughts) I thought something terrible had happened!
Natani: Ah‚Ä¶ sorry, Zen.
Natani: Things have just been crazy here lately. What with the tavern fire and the explosion‚Ä¶
Zen: (thoughts) Fire? Explosion?!
Natani: Yeah‚Ä¶
Natani: Er, wait, no! Don‚Äôt go through my memories! Stop! You shouldn‚Äôt‚Äî!
Zen: (thoughts) You kissed the Basitin?!
Natani: Oh, God‚Ä¶Natani: Look, it didn‚Äôt mean anything‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶
Zen: Snrk‚Ä¶
Natani: I was under a lot of stress, and‚Ä¶ ng‚Ä¶
Zen: Nmmhm‚Ä¶
Zen: Oh, it‚Äôs so nice to finally see my little brother growing into a young woman!
Zen: ~ Oooh, Keith. You‚Äôre so dreamy! I want to feel your warm, sandy fur against mine. ~
Natani: Grraah!!
Natani: If you weren‚Äôt a thousand miles away I‚Äôd kill you!
Keith: Hey, Natani.
Keith: Talking to yourself again, eh?
Natani: Keith!Natani: Jeez, Keith‚Ä¶ are you okay?
Keith: I‚Äôm fine‚Ä¶
Natani: A-alright, if you‚Äôre sure‚Ä¶ Hey, where are we anyway?
Keith: We‚Äôre being held in the far castle tower. It‚Äôs been converted into a medical facility and holding area for us.
Keith: The only way out is through the front gate ‚Äî or down a long drop.
Natani: Well, that‚Äôs not good‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôve been in worse situations.
Natani: I‚Äôm sure we can come up with a plan to break out of here.
Keith: I‚Äôm not escaping.
Natani: Huh?Natani: What do you mean you‚Äôre not escaping? We can‚Äôt stay here! If we don‚Äôt they‚Äôll‚Äî
Keith: Laura‚Äôs dead.
Natani: S-she‚Äôs‚Ä¶!
Keith: Gone. There was nothing left of her.
Keith: And it‚Äôs my fault. Just like Alaric, and my mother, and my father. I killed them all‚Ä¶
Natani: Keith, that‚Äôs not true! You can‚Äôt just give up!
Keith: I didn‚Äôt say I was! I just have no reason to leave anymore. This place is my home, like it or not.
Keith: I might have given it up again for Laura, but now that she‚Äôs gone‚Ä¶ I will accept the consequences of my actions from the new king.
Lynn: Then perhaps you are in luck.Lynn: It is I.. Lynn. Do you remember me?
Lynn: I have a document for you from my master.. General Alaric.
Keith: From Alaric?
Lynn: Yes, I was instructed.. before his death to have it delivered to you.
Lynn: It‚Äôs a legally signed edict declaring you an.. official Basitin citizen.
Lynn: It was originally going to be.. given to you yesterday after your trial, but, well‚Ä¶
Keith: Too little, too late. What‚Äôs the point of having this when they‚Äôll just take it away again once I‚Äôm executed?
Lynn: Well, that‚Äôs.. a depressing way to look at it. Relax.
Lynn: Everything works itself out.. eventually.Flora: (thoughts) Could what the Basitin said be true? Am I really‚Ä¶?
Flora: (thoughts) What would Trace say if I am? Would he think I had‚Ä¶?
Basitin Doctor: (in Keidran) In here is the room of the Human. Please be brief.
Flora: (thoughts) No, the Basitin must be wrong! I can‚Äôt be pregnant. It‚Äôs impossible. Keidran and Humans have lived together for centuries. It would have happened before if it could have‚Ä¶
Flora: (thoughts) She must have just been confused by my Keidran anatomy‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace? Are you alright?
Eric: Hello, Flora! Trace isn‚Äôt here, but you‚Äôre welcome to stay!Flora: But if Trace isn‚Äôt here‚Ä¶ where is he?!
Trace: Ngh‚Ä¶
Trace: Augh‚Ä¶ What happened?
Trace: Ah?!
Nora: (thoughts) The mark on your hand has spread.
Trace: Nora?
Nora: (thoughts) It‚Äôs the corruption of black magic. Eventually it will consume you if you keep using it.
Trace: Where am I? What am I doing here?
Nora: (thoughts) The Basitins‚Ä¶ are going to want someone to blame‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) I had‚Ä¶ had to take you away or they would have killed you.Trace: But what about the others? Are they here?
Nora: (thoughts) Sorry, Trace. I could only make‚Ä¶ one trip‚Ä¶
Nora: Rrrgh‚Ä¶
Trace: Nora? What‚Äôs wrong?
Nora: (thoughts) Trace‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) When the tower exploded, it drained and consumed all the magic on the island. Unfortunately, we dragons are creatures of magic. It fed on my life while I was looking for you.
Nora: (thoughts) It took most of my strength to carry you back, and the rest to heal your wounds.
Nora: (thoughts) Now that I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre okay, I must sleep‚Ä¶ for a very long time.Trace: If I‚Äôm the only one here, Flora and the others might still be in danger. I have to go back‚Ä¶ Oh‚Ä¶ long drop..
Trace: Well, I can just‚Ä¶ huh? I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Magic has been disrupted throughout the island as a result of the tower‚Äôs destruction. I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôre without your powers for the time being.
Trace: ‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) Trace‚Ä¶ I know you want to help them, but‚Ä¶ maybe you could stay here for a while? At least until I fall asleep‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) It would be safe here, and‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd feel better if I wasn‚Äôt going into this long sleep alone‚Ä¶
Trace: ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry, Nora. I‚Äôd like to help, but I just can‚Äôt sit here and wait.
Trace: Not while my friends need me. Magic or no magic, I‚Äôve gotta find them.
Nora: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶But I‚Äôm‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶I understand, Trace.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Lynn: Ah‚Ä¶
Lynn: Looks like your escort has arrived.
Lynn: Please get dressed, your trial is scheduled to begin shortly.
Natani: Hey, wait a minute! Where are you going, Keith? I‚Äôm coming too!
Basitin Soldier: Stay where you are, Keidran! These are Basitin affairs.
Basitin Soldier: Your kind are not welcome.
Keith: Wait! I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like to have the Keidran as my confidant, so that he may sit in during my trial.
Lynn: Are you sure about that? Having a Keidran there will not help your case at all.
Keith: Well, to be honest, I don‚Äôt care what any of them think anymore.Natani: Thanks, Keith.
Natani: I‚Äôm glad you convinced these idiots to bring me along. So, what do you want me to do? Defend your case or something?
Keith: Actually, I didn‚Äôt really want you to come along at all. But I figured you wanted to get away from the others.
Natani: Huh? Why?
Keith: Well, you know, what with you sort of‚Ä¶ broadcasting your gender by scent right now‚Ä¶
Natani: ?
Natani: N-no, that‚Äôs impossible!
Natani: My scent‚Äôs supposed to be magically sealed! How was it dispelled?!
Keith: Relax, Natani!
Keith: The other Basitin won‚Äôt know a Keidran‚Äôs gender by scent. And our friends won‚Äôt be allowed in the castle. You‚Äôll be safe for a while.
Natani: Oh‚Ä¶ thank you, Keith.Madelyn: This trial is a farce! Keith Keiser was helping the Basitin people by destroying that tower!
Madelyn: It was corrupting all who used it!
Aster: There is no evidence of this ‚Äúcorruptive force.‚Äù
Aster: And it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Keith Keiser disobeyed a direct order.
Madelyn: That order was never legal! Keith was only required to bring the Templar to regain his citizenship, nothing else! Alabaster was out of his mind when he ordered that assassination!
Aster: Enough. It‚Äôs time for the boy to speak for himself.Aster: Keith Keiser, for the second time you stand before this court accused of a heinous crime.
Aster: We five have been chosen to determine your guilt, if any, in accordance with Basitin law.
Aster: You are charged with the following: Disobeying a direct order from a superior‚Ä¶ trespassing on royal grounds‚Ä¶ destroying royal property‚Ä¶ committing treason against the Basitin government‚Ä¶ and breaking curfew.
Aster: Do you understand the charges against you?
Keith: Yes‚Ä¶
Aster: Then I, Alabaster, hereby bring this court to order.
Keith: D-did you just say ‚ÄúAlabaster‚Äù?
Aster: That‚Äôs right. I am Lieutenant Alabaster‚Ä¶
Aster: ‚Ä¶son of the late General Alabaster.Aster: I see you‚Äôve brought the Keidran with you as well‚Ä¶ the one you were ordered to kill.
Aster: Are you mocking us by flaunting your disregard for the law in here?
Keith: No, of course not‚Ä¶
Juror 3: Then tell us, Young Man, why exactly did you disobey your orders?
Juror 3: Did you have a legitimate reason? A legal precedent?
Keith: Ngh‚Ä¶
Keith: No, I had no ‚Äòlegal precedent‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt follow the orders because‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt do it.
Keith: That Keidran, Natani, is the closest thing I have to a friend right now. There‚Äôs no way I could kill him.
Juror 3: SIGH‚Ä¶
Juror 3: You were right, Alabaster. Our predecessors should have seen this coming.
Juror 3: The boy‚Äôs just too much like his mother.
Keith: Wha-? What does my mother have to do with anything?Juror 1: Oh please‚Ä¶ This trial is going to be long enough without a history lesson. Let‚Äôs just get on with it!
Juror 2: I disagree! If it has relevance to the case, I‚Äôd like to hear about it!
Aster: I believe it does. Knowing Keith‚Äôs lineage may explain why he has caused so many problems for us.
Aster: When my father died, his belongings were passed down to me ‚Äî including several personal documents. The contents of some were‚Ä¶ revealing‚Ä¶
Aster: Keith Keiser, your mother, Cathleen, was a Western Basitin.
Juror 1: Wha‚Äî?! Really?
Juror 2: That explains it!
Juror 2: He resists orders so easily because he has no compulsion!
Keith: That‚Äôs a lie! My mother was a legal citizen!
Aster: No, it‚Äôs the truth. Your father kept it hidden, forging papers after conceiving an illegitimate offspring ‚Äî you.
Aster: But the secret couldn‚Äôt be kept forever. When rumor spread, your father confided in mine.Cornelius: ‚Ä¶I need to leave this place, Albion.
General Alabaster: What are you talking about, Cornelius? Leave where?
Cornelius: I‚Äôm going to leave the island‚Ä¶ with Cathleen.
General Alabaster: What?!
Cornelius: Suspicions about her origins have been growing. Any day now I‚Äôll be questioned, and I won‚Äôt be able to answer falsely. But‚Ä¶ maybe if we went to human lands we‚Äî
General Alabaster: Listen to yourself! Leave the island?!
General Alabaster: It‚Äôs the drink talking, you can‚Äôt be serious! You‚Äôd be disgraced! Forever labeled a traitor!
Cornelius: It matters not. I will be disgraced either way. At least this way, I will not implicate her or Keith.
Cornelius: I will leave the child here. He is a weak boy, but I‚Äôve done all I can to toughen him.
General Alabaster: (thoughts) No‚Ä¶! I can‚Äôt let him destroy himself! Not for a Western harlot!Narration: Female District
Cathleen: Hello?
General Alabaster: Let me in, Cathleen.
Cathleen: General Alabaster? It‚Äôs passed curfew, Sir. It wouldn‚Äôt be decent‚Ä¶
General Alabaster: And what would you know of decency?
General Alabaster: I knew it was a mistake the moment I forged your papers, but I did it for Cornelius‚Äô sake‚Ä¶ But now he‚Äôs planning to throw his whole life away because of the mistake he made with you!
General Alabaster: Well I won‚Äôt allow it!
Cathleen: Ah!
Cathleen: Let go of me!
General Alabaster: Aaaaaaahhh!Aster: Alabaster claimed that he was forced to kill Cathleen after being attacked unprovoked.
Aster: He did not anticipate what would happen after he left‚Ä¶
Aster: He did not witness what lead up to Cornelius‚Äô death, but his last note detailed the aftermath.
General Alabaster: No!
General Alabaster: Cornelius‚Ä¶
General Alabaster: You‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll make you suffer for this, Boy!Keith: It wasn‚Äôt my father‚Ä¶
Juror 1: So Keith Keiser is a Westerner, and Alabaster was responsible for what happened. But what does that mean in regards to this trial?
Aster: It shows how Keith is able to act independently. However‚Ä¶
Aster: It also gives motive behind my father‚Äôs recent actions. Manipulating Keith‚Äôs orders, burning down a tavern‚Ä¶ My father hated Keith for what he was, and for killing Cornelius. He was willing to go to any lengths to get rid of him for good.
Natani: (in Keidran) Keith, are you alright? What did they say?
Juror 2: I think we should recess.
Aster: Agreed. We will return after the counsel has had time to deliberate.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Mike: The whole ship is crawling with Basitins.
Evals: I told you we should have taken off when we had the chance!
Mike: What were we supposed to do?
Mike: We couldn‚Äôt just abandon everyone on the island‚Ä¶
Evals: It‚Äôs a shame about Kat, I know. But‚Ä¶ The control spells are gone, I can feel it.
Evals: If we just took the ship and left‚Ä¶ we could be free!
Mike: (thoughts) Free‚Ä¶?
Basitin Soldier 1: Did you check everywhere?
Basitin Soldier 2: Yes, we‚Äôve cleared the ship. Everything has been accounted for.
Mike: Phew‚Ä¶
Basitin Soldier 2: The only things left are those two Keidran talking under the floorboards.Evals: Alright, Mike. Here‚Äôs the plan‚Ä¶ we just play it cool, explain ourselves, and maybe they‚Äî
Mike: Don‚Äôt kill me!
Mike: I‚Äôm innocent, I swear! Hiding in here was the dog‚Äôs idea! Take him instead!
Evals: ‚Ä¶..
Mike: EHEH‚Ä¶
Flora: Let me go! I know you‚Äôre holding Trace somewhere! Get off of me!
Kat: Eric?
Basitin Soldier: Ahem‚Ä¶ The Basitin government has acknowledged your status as slaves, and has determined that you cannot be held responsible for actions forced upon you. You are therefore to be expelled from the island. You have one hour to make ready to leave. Your ship will be escorted out of Basitin territory, and then you will be free to go.Evals: Did you hear that? We‚Äôve been set free?
Mike: Just like that?
Flora: No way! I‚Äôm not going anywhere without Trace!
Flora: ‚Ä¶and those other guys too, I suppose.
Basitin Soldier: If you refuse to leave, you will be trespassing and your lives will be forfeit.
Evals: ‚Ä¶
Mike: ‚Ä¶
Evals: Well, I guess I‚Äôd better hoist the sails!
Mike: I‚Äôll raise the anchor!
Evals: Gerk!
Flora: What are you two doing?
Kat: Not going anywhere, I hope?Mike: Well, what do you expect us to do? You heard him! They‚Äôll kill us!
Flora: Oh, come on! Aren‚Äôt you two the men in this group? Man up!
Evals: Look, we‚Äôre not cowards‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶okay, maybe a little‚Ä¶
Evals: ‚Ä¶but fighting against the Basitins would be suicide!
Kat: Maybe they have a point, Flora‚Ä¶ what can we do? None of us are fighters.
Flora: Well‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ but the least we can do is buy some time‚Ä¶
Evals: And why should we?
Evals: We‚Äôve got a chance for freedom, and I for one am not giving it up!Evals: Our control spells are gone. We hold no loyalty towards Eric anymore. So why should we risk our lives and our freedom just to satisfy your‚Ä¶ your‚Ä¶ Human fetish!
Flora: I do not have a ‚Äúhuman fetish‚Äù!
Flora: But‚Ä¶
Flora: You‚Äôre right.
Flora: I‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt ask you to just give up your freedom.
Flora: I have painful memories of my own escape attempts when I was a slave. I can understand the desire for freedom.
Evals: Wait, wait, wait‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhen you were a slave?‚Äù You‚Äôre not one now? Isn‚Äôt that Templar guy your master?Flora: No! Of course not! I‚Äôm a free Keidran! Trace and I are‚Ä¶ together.
Flora: (Okay, maybe I have a tiny human fetish‚Ä¶)
Evals: (thoughts) Huh? A Keidran and a Human‚Ä¶?
Evals: I‚Äôve never heard of such a relationship before. Does he feel the same way about you? Or is it a one-way thing, like with Kat?
Kat: H-hey!
Flora: No, of course he does! At least, I sure hope so‚Ä¶ After what I last said to him, though‚Ä¶
Evals: And he‚Äôs a powerful Human, right? Templar? Hmph‚Ä¶ alright, look. I‚Äôm not going to fight Basitins, no matter what. That‚Äôs for sure! But I can see now why you want him back so badly. And I‚Äôm not heartless. I might be willing to try stalling as best I can. ‚Ä¶On one condition!
Evals: If Eric comes back, you must swear to make that Human of yours buy our freedom.Trace: Nora? Are you asleep yet?
Nora: (thoughts) Trace! you‚Äôre back.
Trace: Yeah, well‚Ä¶
Trace: As I was climbing down I got to thinking‚Ä¶ And I decided it wouldn‚Äôt hurt if I stuck around a little while an kept you company. So‚Ä¶ I decided to come back here.
Nora: (thoughts) Ah‚Ä¶ Trace. That‚Äôs so sweet.
Nora: (thoughts) You couldn‚Äôt find any way off the mountain, could you?
Trace: Completely impassable.Nora: (thoughts) Sigh‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) There‚Äôs a passage at the back of the cave which leads to an old mine.
Nora: (thoughts) If you stay left, it‚Äôll lead you right to the shore.
Trace: There‚Äôs‚Ä¶ you knew about that all along? Why didn‚Äôt you tell me before I nearly ran off the cliffs?
Nora: (thoughts) I was going to!
Nora: (thoughts) But you were in such a hurry to abandon me, I figured you could find your own way off the mountain! Hmph!
Trace: Well, I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt mean it to come across like that. My mind was focused on Flora and the others. But I honestly did not mean to hurt your feelings. I didn‚Äôt even know a dragon‚Äôs feelings could‚Ä¶ er‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶it‚Äôs alright. I know, you have new companions now. I can‚Äôt expect you to forsake your friends for‚Ä¶ someone you don‚Äôt remember.Trace: So, Nora‚Ä¶
Trace: How long does this ‚Äúlong sleep‚Äù usually last?
Nora: (thoughts) Trace? Why are you still here? I told you the way out.
Trace: I know‚Ä¶
Trace: But I wasn‚Äôt lying when I said I wanted to keep you company. I might not remember, but it seems like you were an important part of my past.
Trace: I think I‚Äôd regret it if I didn‚Äôt stay, at least for a little while.
Nora: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶
Trace: Wait, I changed my mind!
Nora: ‚ô•
Trace: Blarg!Aster: We are prepared to render judgement.
Aster: Keith Keiser, you have committed serious crimes that we cannot ignore. You may have been acting in the best interests of our people when you destroyed the tower‚Ä¶
Aster: But the means at which you achieved it cannot go without consequences.
Aster: However‚Ä¶ we must also acknowledge that these are unusual circumstances. In lieu of recent‚Ä¶ revelations, I am prepared to grant you leniency.
Natani: ?
Aster: Rather than execution, your citizenship will simply not be reinstated. You are once again banished from these islands; this time, without any opportunity to return. You shall be escorted out the way you arrived, along with the Keidran slaves.
Aster: However, this leniency does not extend to the outsiders!
Aster: An attack on our people cannot be forgiven.
Aster: Therefore, your companions are sentenced to death.
Keith: What?!Aster: Take the Keidran away. And escort the exile to the docks.
Natani: (in Keidran) Wha-? Hey! Get off of me!
Natani: (in Keidran) What‚Äôs going on, Keith? Grr‚Ä¶ let go!
Keith: You haven‚Äôt given them a trial! They destroyed the tower for the good of the Basitin people! That should count for something!
Aster: We are not obliged to give trials to outsiders. Under the law, destruction of government property is a crime punishable by death.
Keith: Ngh‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt you have any minds of your own?!
Keith: I won‚Äôt let you do this! The laws are wrong!
Natani: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶is this still part of the trial?Aster: Keith, what are you doing?!
Juror 3: How dare you blaspheme the law!
Keith: The law is not a religious doctrine!
Keith: The laws were made to help us govern ourselves‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs been left to rule on its own. Somewhere along the line, it‚Äôs been twisted into‚Ä¶ scripture! And it‚Äôs used as an excuse not to think. I‚Äôve had to see my family and friends die from this mind-set‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶but I can‚Äôt stand by and watch it happen anymore! I won‚Äôt!
Aster: Then you‚Äôll join by their sides!
Aster: Guards! Take them away!
Keith: (in Keidran) Natani, get ready to run‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) What the hell‚Äôs going on?!
Basitin Soldier 1: Don‚Äôt move!
Basitin Soldier 2: Don‚Äôt move!
Basitin Soldier 3: Put your weapon down!
Lynn: Stop!Natani: Gasp!
Keith: Natani‚Ä¶
Natani: Huh?
Keith: This way.
Natani: Oh.Lynn: Erm‚Ä¶ was that dramatic enough? I was told to make it as dramatic as possible‚Ä¶
Aster: Messenger Lynn! This is an active courtroom. Get out of he‚Äî ERK!
Aster: Y-your highness!
King Adelaide: Magistrate. Lynn has informed me that he has important information in regards to this trial. I am here to ensure that it gets heard.
Lynn: Yes. I have a document written by the late General Alaric.Aster: My Lady, you‚Äôre okay!
Juror 2: We were told you‚Äôd been fatally wounded!
King Adelaide: Yes, I‚Äôd been told that as well. I chose to ignore it and continue living.
King Adelaide: The healers feared I would succumb to my illness without the healing properties of the tower.
King Adelaide: They were quick to assure everyone I had been killed in the blast, to ensure my death would be considered ‚Äúhonorable.‚Äù Tragically, I survived.
King Adelaide: In fact, I feel stronger than I have in years. Which leads me to suspect that my ‚Äúillness‚Äù may not have been entirely‚Ä¶ natural.
Aster: Are‚Ä¶ are you suggesting the humans were not just alleviating the illness, but supplying it? If this is true‚Ä¶ this is a call for war!
Aster: And it‚Äôs all the more reason why these outsiders should be executed! Nothing good comes from people of other lands!
King Adelaide: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Aster‚Ä¶
King Adelaide: But you do not have the authority to make that judgement.Aster: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have the authority?‚Äù
Aster: Your Highness, a lot has changed since you were injured. If you are not aware‚Ä¶
Aster: All three of our generals have been killed, my father included. Alaric‚Äôs body is still being recovered from the bottom of the gorge.
Aster: Since the power vacuum, nearly every officer on the island has been competing to determine who should fill the void.
Aster: So far, I have defeated all challengers for the honor of ascending to the position of general, so that I may preside over this trial. Tell me, who has greater authority to rule over these matters than I?
Lynn: Oh! Well‚Ä¶ According to Alaric, that would be‚Ä¶
Lynn: Keith.
Aster: ‚Ä¶Juror 3: I don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶ Is this a joke? Keith Keiser has no rank or title.
Juror 3: He is not even a legal citizen.
Lynn: Oh, but that‚Äôs just not true.
Lynn: When Alaric discovered Alabaster‚Äôs manipulation, he granted Keith‚Äôs citizenship himself. And since Keith is the only living Basitin to return from the outside world, Alaric decided his experience would make him worthy of promotion.
Aster: That‚Äôs not how it works! Rank is not something you‚Äôre handed! It can only be earned through strength of body or will of mind!
Aster: And Keith Keiser has neither!
Lynn: I think you underestimate our wayward brother. But you are correct.
Lynn: The law states rank can only be earned through succession or combat.
Lynn: However, if you can recall the conditions of General Alaric‚Äôs death‚Ä¶
Lynn: Keith Keiser defeated Nickolai Alaric in single combat on the western bridge.
Aster: What‚Ä¶ th‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt count!Aster: I won‚Äôt accept it!
Aster: That challenge cannot be considered legitimate! No one witnessed it happen! For all we know, the Keidran murdered Alaric with sorcery!
Madelyn: I witnessed it!
Aster: Erk! You?
Madelyn: Yes, I was asked to document everything. I gave it to the wolf.
Lynn: (in Keidran) Excuse me, Confused Wolf‚Ä¶ Do you happen to still have the document you were given?
Natani: (in Keidran) Huh?
Natani: (in Keidran) I have no ‚Äúdocument.‚Äù
Natani: (in Keidran) Well, unless you mean this thing.
Madelyn: On the 28th of August, Year 482, I, Lieutenant Madelyn Adelaide, witnessed a duel between Keith Keiser and Nickolai Alaric‚Ä¶ and it was awesome! You should have seen it. At first, Keith was all like ‚Äúoh noes!‚Äù but then he‚Äî
Aster: This is insanity‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt you people see what‚Äôs going on? Alaric is making a mockery of our government just to get Keith into power!
Aster: We cannot allow this!Aster: No, I cannot allow this! Keith Keiser, I challenge y‚Äî
King Adelaide: Stand down, Alabaster.
Aster: But‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs my right‚Ä¶
King Adelaide: You can‚Äôt challenge the boy while he‚Äôs injured. It wouldn‚Äôt be valid.
Lynn: Besides, he‚Äôs not taking away your position.
Aster: ‚Ä¶He‚Äôs not?
Lynn: No, Alaric knew General Keiser would be challenged immediately, and decided he would be better suited to fulfill a new role, as ambassador. He will hold authority over all foreign matters ‚Äî including the fate of the outsiders.
Aster: ‚Ä¶You‚Äôre telling me this runt‚Ä¶ this bastard child of a Westerner‚Ä¶ the boy who helped murder my father just yesterday, is now going to represent our entire civilization to the rest of the world?!
Lynn: Yep.
Aster: Your Highness, how can you stand there and allow this?
King Adelaide: Because I happen to agree. Our society cannot remain isolated forever. The outside world is being stirred up more every day. Perhaps an ambassador is just what we need.
King Adelaide: However, if you feel so strongly opposed to my decision, you‚Äôre more than welcome to challenge me.Aster: I‚Ä¶ I submit to the wisdom of the king.
Lynn: There. You see? I told you everything would work out.
Keith: I don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶
Keith: How could Alaric do all of this?
Keith: He couldn‚Äôt have known what would happen.
Lynn: He planned for many things.
Lynn: Though I‚Äôm sure he hoped it wouldn‚Äôt come to this. Do you think this is the only document he made?
Lynn: The day you were banished, Alaric devoted himself to avenging you. He drafted hundreds of documents that exploited every loophole in the system. It was the very reason he became a general. He was obsessed with bringing you back, and the idea that those who had cast you out would one day be forced to acknowledge you.
Keith: But‚Ä¶ why? Why do all this for me?
Lynn: Because you were his friend, and he wanted to see you happy.Narration: Dragon Caves

Trace: Hello?
Nora: (thoughts) She was in your arms when I found you, but I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe you tried to save her. It‚Äôs too late though.

Trace: Why didn‚Äôt you tell me she was here from the start? She needs a doctor!
Nora: (thoughts) I didn‚Äôt know who she was. It wouldn‚Äôt have mattered anyway. No amount of medicine can heal those injuries. The best thing I could do for her is induce sleep. Her death will be slow, but painless.

Nora: (thoughts) You can‚Äôt use that power again!
Trace: But what else am I supposed to do? I can‚Äôt just leave her to die!
Nora: (thoughts) Trace, every time you use that power, you draw from your own lifeforce. That magic always comes at a cost. It will destroy you! And if you take her back to the Basitin, they‚Äôll only kill you as well.
Nora: (thoughts) You must learn to accept that sometimes death is inevitable, or you will be destined to return to a path you‚Äôve traveled before. Please‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt sacrifice yourself.
Trace: Ngh‚Ä¶

Trace: You mentioned you were captured by Keidran? Why would Keidran enslave their own kind?
Laura: Ngh‚Ä¶ you really have no memories, eh? It‚Äôs a common practice in the slave trade.
Laura: Humans aren‚Äôt technically allowed to cross the border to hunt for slaves‚Ä¶ erg‚Ä¶ so they hire wolves or dogs to do the job for them.
Laura: We foxes are a common target. Most Keidran races don‚Äôt hold any more loyalty towards each other than they do towards humans.
Laura: And it‚Äôs not as though Keidran don‚Äôt have their own slave trade as well.

Aster: The slaver I can understand, and maybe even the Keidran Spy, but releasing the Templar?
Aster: You saw all the destruction he caused first-hand! He cannot be allowed to go unpunished!
King Adelaide: Enough, General. Keith Keiser explained that the human was just as manipulated as we were. I saw the chains and the look in his eyes, and I‚Äôm inclined to believe that. He was a man possessed by evil magic. Now let it go.
Aster: Ngh‚Ä¶

Keith: ‚Ä¶.. I thought you of all people would want to see me gone. Or are you just objecting to any action I take out of spite?Aster: No, it‚Äôs not spite. You don‚Äôt deserve your title, but it‚Äôs done, and I accept it.
Keith: And that title is ‚ÄúAmbassador‚Äù isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs my job to visit other nations‚Äî
Aster: At the behest of your king! Not because you want to escape your problems!
Aster: You‚Äôre an adult now, Keith. You can‚Äôt just fold and run when life gets hard.
Aster: Your experience living among outsiders was what got you that title. Experience our people are going to need if recent events with the Templar are a sign of things to come.
Aster: Sigh‚Ä¶
Aster: Regardless, it‚Äôs not my decision. Here.
Aster: Her Majesty decided to approve your leave, against my counsel.
Aster: I hope one day you find where you really belong.Madelyn: Um‚Ä¶ General Keiser‚Ä¶ Sir?
Madelyn: We‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve finished. The ship is finished being resupplied and‚Ä¶ everything else was done as you asked.
Madelyn: The men tried the best they could to adhere to Keidran ritual.
Madelyn: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry for your loss.
Madelyn: I know this is a difficult time, but we are your people. I‚Ä¶ we could help you through it. Are you sure you want to leave so soon?
Keith: Yes, I‚Äôm sure. I have to bring Laura back‚Ä¶
Keith: I owe it to her‚Ä¶
Madelyn: ‚Ä¶I understand, Sir.Evals: Ngh!
Mike: Ngh!
Juror 1: There they go.
Juror 1: ‚Ä¶He‚Äôs not coming back, is he?
Aster: Hmph, we should be so lucky. Good riddance.
King Adelaide: Don‚Äôt be so sure we‚Äôve seen the last of our wayward kin.
King Adelaide: A storm is brewing in the north. There may soon come a time when we will be the ones to come to him.Narration: Below deck‚Ä¶
Kat: Wow! Look at all this stuff the Basitins gave us!
Eric: Well‚Ä¶ ‚Äògave Keith‚Äô anyway. I suppose they want to show support for their General.
Eric: Ah, here‚Äôs the manifest. Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ 100 kg of food 200 litres of water 3 crates of wine‚Ä¶ Weapons, armor, clothing‚Ä¶ formal ankle coverings? Various tools and supplies, medicine, lamp oil, and spices.
Eric: ‚Ä¶Kat, get out of the food.
Kat: Aw‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hungry‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt get to eat anything before we set sail!
Eric: We‚Äôve got plenty of our own supplies without taking from Keith‚Äôs! Come on, let‚Äôs see if the others are ready for dinner.

MutinyFlora: What do you mean ‚Äòno‚Äô?!
Eric: I‚Äôm sorry, Flora. I told you, I‚Äôm not willing to release them.
Flora: Why not?!
Flora: They stuck their neck out for you!
Flora: They could have easily taken this ship for themselves and ran when the Basitins said so. But they didn‚Äôt. They risked their freedom for you and the others!
Eric: Flora, I can‚Äôt just release a slave every time he does what he‚Äôs supposed to do. Again, I apologize, but you knew what business I was in when you agreed to come aboard.Flora: Alright, if it‚Äôs just business, then fine! We‚Äôll buy them!
Eric: Flora‚Ä¶ even if I intended to sell‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶I know Trace doesn‚Äôt have enough on hand to afford even one of them.
Eric: My answer has to still be no.
Evals: TSCH!
Evals: I‚Äôm out of here‚Ä¶
Mike: Oh, alright. Wait up!
Flora: I can‚Äôt believe you! You actually had me fooled for a while into thinking you really did care for Keidran in your own weird way.
Flora: But you really are just a perverted hypocrite!Evals: Grrrrrrrraaaah!
Mike: Hey! Calm down, Evals! You‚Äôre going to hurt yourself!
Evals: Calm down?! Why should I? For the first time in four years I can finally think for myself again! There‚Äôs no magic constantly controlling my every action!
Evals: But any day now Eric‚Äôs going to figure it out and put it back, and we‚Äôll lose our chance for freedom forever! So how can you be so calm?!
Mike: ‚ÄòOy!
Mike: Evals, it‚Äôs different for me! I was born into slavery. Unlike you, I don‚Äôt have any place to go back to!
Evals: What? So are you saying you enjoy being a slave?
Mike: No! You know I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs more complicated.
Evals: I‚Äôs not complicated at all! You‚Äôd just come back with me!Mike: You don‚Äôt understand!
Mike: It‚Äôs not that simple for me!
Mike: I‚Äôve lived my whole life among humans. Human cities‚Ä¶ human music‚Ä¶ human foods‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever known.
Mike: The life of a Keidran‚Ä¶ living on the land in a tribe‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs entirely foreign to me!
Mike: I can‚Äôt just run out into the wilderness to live among wild Keidran. I have no survival skills. I don‚Äôt know Keidran customs or traditions. I can‚Äôt even speak the Keidran language very well! I would not survive!
Mike: I‚Äôm a Keidran, but my culture is human.
Mike: I want to be free, but‚Ä¶ I also want to continue working and living in the human cities I‚Äôve always called home.
Evals: Well, I‚Äôm sorry to burst your bubble, Mike, but your dream‚Äôs a fantasy. Humans and Keidran living together will never happen. They‚Äôll never accept us as equals.
Evals: So you‚Äôd better make up your mind whose side you‚Äôre on, and soon‚Ä¶
Evals: Because I‚Äôm not going to wait around for Eric to remove my will again!Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Natani: Snnrrrk!
Flora: It‚Äôs not fair!
Trace: Flora, relax. We‚Äôll think of something.
Natani: Nngh‚Ä¶

Natani: ?
Trace: I can try talking with him, but I don‚Äôt know what else we can do.
Natani: (in Keidran) Can you understand what they‚Äôre arguing about?
Zen: (in Keidran) I dunno. Something about slaves. ‚ÄòMorning, by the way. Coffee?
[World‚Äôs greatest assassin]Natani: Damn. My favorite robes are really falling apart.
Zen: Ouch. Maybe you could try asking one of the girls if they can sew it back together?
Natani: Hm, I suppose it‚Äôs worth a try. I don‚Äôt have much else in the way of clothes.
Zen: Shoot! Targets are moving! Here, hold my mug! I gotta go before they spot me. I‚Äôm planning to strike tonight!

Evals: Hey, You!
Natani: Huh?
Evals: ‚ÄòBout time you woke up. I‚Äôve got a proposition for you‚Ä¶Natani: So let me get this straight‚Ä¶ you want me to help you mutiny?
Evals: Hey! Not so loud! I never said that!
Evals: Aaaall I said was‚Ä¶ if someone happened to cause some sort of dispute‚Ä¶ And it was either us or the humans‚Ä¶
Evals: Theoretically speaking‚Ä¶ who would you side with?
Evals: Now before you answer, consider‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a dog, you‚Äôre a wolf. they‚Äôre practically the same thing!
Evals: And your short friend‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a non-human too.
Evals: If you could convince him, we could easily hypothetically overtake the ship. So what do you say?
Natani: Not interested.
Evals: What?! B-but‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre your own kind!
Evals: Alright, fine! Just‚Ä¶ forget about what I said, then!
Natani: I‚Äôve got enough to worry about‚Ä¶ But if the slaves really are planning to revolt‚Ä¶Natani: I really should do something about that, but‚Äî Mrrf? I smell food‚Ä¶ coffee‚Ä¶
Kat: Oh, Hey! Good morning, Natani! Hungry? You‚Äôre just in time for second breakfast, if you want some!
Natani: Uh, yeah, sure. That‚Äôd be great. ‚Ä¶ Say‚Ä¶
Natani: You wouldn‚Äôt happen to know how to sew? My robes are pretty torn up.
Kat: Oh? Let me see!
Kat: Hm‚Ä¶ yeah, it‚Äôs pretty bad‚Ä¶
Kat: But, if you give me some time to clean up, I‚Äôll see what I can do!Kat: Here‚Äôs the laundry room!
Kat: Just need a few things‚Ä¶ needle, cloth, thread‚Ä¶
Kat: Alright, I‚Äôm set! Now, take off your robes!
Natani: W-wait! T-take them off? Right now?
Kat: Well, of course, silly! I can‚Äôt fix them if you don‚Äôt give them to me! Here, let me help you out!
Natani: No-no-no stop!
Kat: Huh? I don‚Äôt understand. I thought you wanted me to fix them?
Natani: Well, yeah, but‚Ä¶ C-can‚Äôt you just sew it while I still have it on?
Kat: Well, I suppose I could try. But it‚Äôd be easier if you took them off. Plus you wouldn‚Äôt have to stay the whole time.
Natani: I don‚Äôt mind waiting! Really, I‚Äôd prefer it this way.Kat: (thoughts) Hm‚Ä¶ these bandages‚Ä¶
Natani: H-hey! What do you think you‚Äôre doing?! Don‚Äôt mess with that!Kat: Oh, sorry, sorry! I didn‚Äôt hurt you, did I?
Natani: Hurt me?
Kat: Your bandages‚Ä¶ they are for wounds you received at the tower, right? Is that why you didn‚Äôt want to remove your robes?
Natani: Er‚Ä¶ Yeeees! That‚Äôs the reason! Heh heh.. heh‚Ä¶
Kat: Natani! Being injured is nothing to be ashamed of! What if you were to get an infection and no one knew about it?
Kat: You should let me have a look just in case!
Natani: No no! It‚Äôs healing just fine! I swear! C-can you please just finish sewing so I can get out of here?
Kat: But‚Ä¶ I know some first aid. I just want to make sure you‚Äôre okay.Natani: So‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre both a cook and a seamstress. Do you really know medicine, too?
Kat: Well‚Ä¶ sort of. I‚Äôve read up on it, anyway. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve learned a lot of what I can do.
Natani: Reading?
Kat: Oh yeah! Ever since Eric taught me how to read, I‚Äôve loved learning about all sorts of interesting things. Cook books, apothecary journals, magic scrolls‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all fascinating!
Natani: Really‚Ä¶ huh.
Natani: I‚Ä¶ never learned how. To read, that is. Not much, anyway. It wasn‚Äôt exactly a priority growing up.
Kat: Oh, you should!
Kat: Would you like me to help teach you? There‚Äôs so much to be gained from them.
Kat: And they aren‚Äôt all educational, you know! There‚Äôs also so many books on people and places from all over the world!
Kat: It‚Äôs great to be able to experience it all, if only through stories.Kat: Anyway, if you ever want lessons, I‚Äôd be more than willing!
Natani: ‚Ä¶
Natani: Hey Spots‚Ä¶ have you ever thought about going out and experiencing those places in your books for yourself?
Kat: Huh? What do you mean?
Natani: I mean‚Ä¶ have you ever wanted to be free. You know, free to go do whatever you wanted‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶experience whatever you wanted.

Trace: I promise I‚Äôll work something out with him.
Flora: Thank you, Trace.
Flora: Ah! Well‚Ä¶
Flora: I‚Ä¶ I hope you can talk some sense into him.
Trace: Flora, is there something wrong?
Trace: Ever since we left, you‚Äôve been distant. You know you can tell me anything.
Flora: It‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs nothing! I‚Äôm just concerned.
Trace: ‚Ä¶it‚Äôs me, isn‚Äôt it?
Flora: Huh?Trace: It‚Äôs because I lost control again, that night at the tower. I let you down again.
Flora: No! It‚Äôs not that. That wasn‚Äôt your fault. The Templar made you change like that!
Trace: Then what?
Trace: Is it the hand? I can tell every time you look at me that something is bothering you. What is it?
Flora: It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure‚Ä¶
Trace: Flora, it‚Äôs alright. Whatever it is, you know you can trust me.
Trace: I‚Äôve been thinking a lot, too, since that night‚Ä¶
Trace: The more I learn about my past, the more I‚Äôve come to realize how much better off I am now without it. I used to want to remember. But being told just made me realize the terrible person I‚Äôd been. I understand now that losing it all was the best thing to happen to me. So I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm not going to let myself do anything to put us at risk anymore.
Flora: W-what do you mean?Trace: I mean I‚Äôm done trying to chase down my past. The Templar, black magic‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no point in dwelling on it anymore.
Trace: It‚Äôs time I started thinking about the present, and doing what I can to put things right. Starting with the slaves.
Trace: I‚Äôm headed to talk with Eric. Don‚Äôt worry, Flora. One way or another, I‚Äôll make him see reason. They‚Äôll leave the ship as free men, and we can all head to Lyn‚Äôknoll together. How does that sound?
Flora: ‚Ä¶Thank you, Trace. I‚Äôd like that.
Trace: ‚Ä¶There‚Äôs just one thing I have to take care of first, Flora.Flora: Sigh‚Ä¶
Flora: Flora, you‚Äôre an idiot.
Flora: He was right there, he even asked! You should have told him the truth.
Flora: But‚Ä¶ what even is the truth?
Flora: All the symptoms I‚Äôve had‚Ä¶ if that Basitin was right‚Ä¶ If I am pregnant‚Ä¶ then how? And‚Ä¶ what if Trace asks the same question?
Flora: What if he thinks I‚Ä¶
Flora: No! I can‚Äôt think like that! And I can‚Äôt hide it forever.
Flora: I need to trust Trace! I have to work up the courage and just say‚Ä¶
Flora: I‚Äôm pregnant!

Flora: Thank you!
Flora: Actually, it‚Äôs kind of a relief to let it out. You see, I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm really pregnant or not. I‚Äôve only been with Trace! And‚Ä¶ Keidran can‚Äôt have children with Humans, right?

Eric: Even if I could sell them to you, you wouldn‚Äôt have the funds for it.

Trace: This book is a journal of mine. It details, among other things, my old finances.

Mike: Huh?
Mike: Are you seeing the same thing as me? She clearly has the body of a woman‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Okay, snap neck at third vertebrae‚Ä¶ Kat should be easy to strangle‚Ä¶
Kat: Natani, you‚Äôre a man, right?
Natani: Huh? Y-yes! Like I said, it‚Äôs not how it looks!
Kat: Don‚Äôt worry, I understand, Natani! I‚Äôve read about those like you before.
Natani: Those‚Ä¶ like me?
Kat: You know, people who identify themselves as something other than how they were born. There was a book in Eric‚Äôs library about a canid general who was only discovered to be female years later. I learned all about it from there. And if it‚Äôs the same with Natani, you should be referring to him as a ‚Äúhe‚Äù, Mike!
Natani: (thoughts) Wait‚Ä¶ There have been‚Ä¶ others like me?Mike: No, no, you don‚Äôt understand, Kat! Natani‚Äôs not like that! Weeell, he is in the wrong body. But not for the reason you think! It‚Äôs the black Basitin magic! I saw it happen! Keith turned Natani into a girl weeks ago!
Kat: Huh?
Kat: Whaaat? Keith doesn‚Äôt seem like the kind of guy to do that! Why would he?
Kat: Besides, Eric said Basitin can‚Äôt use magic, or it drives them crazy!
Mike: Yeah, well‚Ä¶ Keith didn‚Äôt know that until a few days ago!
Mike: And have you seen Keith lately? I think he‚Äôs gone a bit funny.
Mike: I know it sounds daft, but it‚Äôs the truth! I know, because‚Ä¶ he did the same thing to me.
Kat: What, really? You turned into a girl too?!
Natani: WatMike: But the curse only lasted a day for me.
Mike: I didn‚Äôt know Natani had it this whole time!
Kat: Is that true, Natani? Is it really just an illusion?
Natani: Hahaha! Of course it is, silly girl!
Natani: You think I really look like this?! Don‚Äôt be ridiculous!
Kat: I wonder if they feel like illusions too.
Natani: Hey hey hey! Keep your hands to yourself!
Kat: Sorry!
Eric: (in Human) Mike! Michael, get up here! Now!
Mike: Eric!
Kat: The others are coming back!
Kat: Come on, let‚Äôs go, Natani!Mike: Erm, Eric‚Ä¶ um, sir, did you call me?
Eric: Yes, come over here.
Mike: Eh-?
Mike: My neck thingy‚Ä¶
Eric: As I thought, both of you have had your control spells disabled.
Eric: And of course with the first chance of freedom, you sabotaged the ship. Then tried to flee on the lifeboat.
Evals: I told you, we had nothing to do with it! I was taking a nap for crying out loud!
Eric: A likely story. I think your plan was just discovered early, so you tried to feign sleep.
Eric: Doesn‚Äôt matter.
Eric: I‚Äôve had enough time now to restore the control spells.
Eric: Soon you two will be back to normal.
Evals: No! Not again! I didn‚Äôt do it, I swear! Please, don‚Äôt put me under it again!Flora: Eric, stop!
Trace: Maybe we should wait until we have all the facts first!
Eric: This is the simplest way to know for sure. It‚Äôs the only way I can know for sure.
Evals: No! No! Not again! Stop!!
Evals: Gack!
Evals: Eurgh‚Ä¶
Eric: How do you feel now, Evals?
Evals: Fine, sir. I‚Äôm sorry I tried to resist earlier.
Eric: Now, I order you to tell me truthfully. Did you set fire to my ship?Evals: Grrr‚Ä¶
Evals: No, I didn‚Äôt!
Eric: What?!
Flora: You see, Eric! Stop jumping to conclusions!
Eric: Evals, answer truthfully: Have you conspired against me or anyone else on this ship in any way since we left the island?
Evals: Grrgh! Y-yes! I attempted to gain support‚Ä¶ for a mutiny.
Eric: Ah! Ah ha! You see? I was right!
Mike: No! You don‚Äôt understand! His actions were not malicious! He was just scared! Scared of what‚Äôs happening right now!
Eric: So you‚Äôre saying you knew about the conspiracy too! Get over here, Mike, you‚Äôre next!Mike: I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Eric: Didn‚Äôt you hear me? I said ‚Äúcome here!‚Äù
Kat: Eric!
Eric: Huh?
Kat: Stop! Eric, please, this isn‚Äôt like you. Stop this!
Eric: Kat, get out of the way!
Eric: I‚Äôm doing this to protect us! I have to find out what they know! And they can‚Äôt be allowed to run loose unshackled! We can‚Äôt know if they can be trusted!
Kat: W-well‚Ä¶ well if that‚Äôs how you feel‚Ä¶ then maybe you should put one of those collars on me, too! After all ‚Äî in case you‚Äôve forgotten ‚Äî I‚Äôm one of ‚Äúthem‚Äù too! I‚Ä¶ I could be a part of it! You can‚Äôt know!
Eric: W-what?! What‚Äôs gotten into you, Kat? You know I would never‚Ä¶Eric: I‚Äôd never do that to you. I care about you‚Ä¶
Kat: And you don‚Äôt care about the others?
Eric: That‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not the same! The collars are necessary for those two, but you know you‚Äôre special to me.
Kat: Well obviously not special enough to change the fact that I‚Äôm still your slave, just like them!
Eric: W-what?! Kat, what are you saying? You‚Äôve never expressed any unhappiness with me before. Where is this coming from?
Kat: I‚Äôm not unhappy with you, Eric! I didn‚Äôt want to bring it up like this‚Ä¶ Ever since you rescued me from your brother, I‚Äôve been grateful to you. You‚Äôve always been so kind to me, but‚Ä¶ I want to be more than just your servant.
Eric: Kathrin‚Ä¶ I never thought‚Ä¶ why haven‚Äôt you ever talked to me about this before?
Kat: I‚Äî I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶
Kat: Maybe I‚Äôve been foolish. I think a part of me has always hoped one day‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd care enough‚Ä¶
Kat: That I wouldn‚Äôt have to ask.
Eric: !Eric: I never realized‚Ä¶ I mean, I never even considered that you might want‚Ä¶ Oh, Kat‚Ä¶
Eric: This is something I need to‚Ä¶ think about. But of course‚Ä¶ if freedom is what you want‚Ä¶ I guess I can work something out.
Kat: R-really?!
Kat: And the others? What about them?
Eric: I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. This is too much! I need‚Ä¶ time to think!
Eric: And I can‚Äôt think while the ship might still be in danger!
Flora: Eric! Haven‚Äôt you ever considered that maybe the fire was just an accident all along?
Flora: That it was no one‚Äôs fault?
Madelyn: She‚Äôs right! It was an accident!
Eric: W-what? Who the‚Ä¶
Madelyn: Though, it may have been my fault‚Ä¶
Madelyn: OOh, but first, allow me to introduce myself!
Madelyn: The name‚Äôs Madelyn Adelaide, but my friends call me Maddie Addie! Nice to meet ‚Äòcha!Eric: ‚Ä¶What?!
Eric: Where the hell did you come from? How did you get on my ship?
Madelyn: Oh, it wasn‚Äôt very hard! I‚Äôm small, and there weren‚Äôt many people around.
Madelyn: We‚Äî I mean I just walked right on board before you left and hid in a barrel. You know, for a ship this size, you sure don‚Äôt have a lot of crew‚Ä¶
Eric: So it was you who set my ship on fire?!
Madelyn: I-It wasn‚Äôt on purpose! Someone left a lanturn on top of my barrel. When I lifted the lid to leave, it came crashing down! I was putting it out when I heard running and, well‚Ä¶ panicked.
Madelyn: But now you know it was all just an accident! No one needs to be blamed, and there‚Äôs no hard feelings! Right?
Madelyn: ‚Ä¶R-right?
Narration: The Brig
Madelyn: Aw‚Ä¶Eric: Well‚Ä¶
Eric: I suppose that settles that. The saboteur has been caught.
Madelyn: Arrru‚Ä¶
Flora: Eric, you‚Äôre not just gunna keep her locked up forever, are you? She‚Äôs just a kid.
Eric: Even a young Basitin can be dangerous. She stays as long as necessary, until we know why she‚Äôs here. But questioning comes later. One problem at a time‚Ä¶
Eric: Mike, Evals, I suppose I was wrong. You two didn‚Äôt have anything to do with the fire. And‚Ä¶ maybe I over-reacted‚Ä¶ just a little.
Eric: Though I‚Äôm sure you can see why what I did was necessary.
Eric: Please, for now, return to your rooms until things can be sorted out. I‚Ä¶ will allow your collars to stay off for now.
Eric: Trace, can you meet me in my cabin? I think it‚Äôs time to negotiate.
Trace: Uh, alright.Eric: Trace, I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre aware of this, but‚Ä¶
Eric: Templar laws have, in recent years, made it a crime for slave traders such as myself to free our slaves voluntarily.
Trace: What? Why? What kind of evil person would make a law like th‚Ä¶ it was me, wasn‚Äôt it?
Eric: ‚Ä¶Yes. If Mike and Evals were ever caught by the Templar in the future, and it was discovered that I released them‚Ä¶
Eric: Well‚Ä¶
Eric: Let‚Äôs just say it could potentially put me or my family at great risk. I have no desire to see the inside of a Templar dungeon.
Eric: Technically, it‚Äôs illegal to even sell to someone knowing they intend to release the slaves. However, for Kathrin‚Äôs sake‚Ä¶ I am willing to take that risk if you are.
Eric: On one condition: It has to be a legitimate trade.
Eric: We will go to the village of Edinmire, near the Tiger border, and I‚Äôll document that I sold the slaves. After that, we can all go our separate ways from there.Flora: Well? Well?!
Flora: What did he say?
Trace: He‚Ä¶ agreed. He said I could buy them and set them free.
Flora: Really?!
Trace: Yeah, he even gave me the keys to their cuffs.
Flora: Trace, I knew you could do it! Oh! Can I be the one to tell them? Pleeease?
Trace: O-of course! Though, I didn‚Äôt really do anything. I think what Kathrin said is what got to him.
Flora: Oh, speaking of Kat! I can‚Äôt wait to tell her, too! I mean sure, it‚Äôs not going to be much different for her, but still, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äî
Trace: Flora, wait!
Flora: Huh?
Trace: Eric‚Ä¶ Eric didn‚Äôt agree to sell Kathrin.
Flora: W-what? You mean he‚Äôs not going to set her free?
Trace: No, no! It‚Äôs not that.
Trace: He just told me it was something he had to do himself.Eric: Kat! There you are. We should talk. I‚Äôve agreed to let Mike and Evals go.
Kat: Really?!
Eric: As for you‚Ä¶ well, you were born into my family, not bought. So‚Ä¶ I can free you directly. And I will. But there‚Äôs more.
Eric: What you said made me realize how unfair I‚Äôve been to you. You‚Äôve always been more than a slave to me, but it took what you said to make me realize it myself. So I want you to know that I feel the same way‚Ä¶
Kat: You do?!
Kat: Oh Eric, thank you! That makes me so happy!
Eric: I‚Äôm glad!
Eric: It‚Äôs something I should have said a long time ago. You‚Äôve always been like a sister to me, and I love you.
Kat: Like‚Ä¶ a sister?
Eric: Yes! And now it‚Äôs time I acted like the brother I am.
Eric: It doesn‚Äôt matter what you or I am. We grew up together, and no matter how different we are‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll always consider you family. Nothing will ever change that. ‚Ä¶A-are you alright, Kat?
Kat: ‚Ä¶Yes, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fine.
Kat: I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ so happy.

Chapter Fifteen
HauntedLaura: Okay, Keith. I understand, it‚Äôs been a long time. I know this is sudden. I‚Ä¶ I shouldn‚Äôt have expected things to go back to the way they were‚Ä¶
Keith: Wait‚Ä¶ no!
Keith: Laura, I‚Äôve reconsidered! I don‚Äôt need more time! I want us to be together again.
Laura: Huh?
Laura: You want us-? B-but what about your people?
Keith: It doesn‚Äôt matter anymore! I don‚Äôt need to stay here. All I want is to return with you!
Laura: R-really? You mean it?
Keith: Yes!
Laura: Oh, thank you, Keith! That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever wanted to hear.
Laura: You have no idea how long I‚Äôve waited. I‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ I wish this was how it happened.
Keith: Ah!
Keith: SIGHKeith: Hmph‚Ä¶
Lynn: Having trouble sleeping, Keith?
Keith: Huh?
Keith: You? What are you doing here? How did you get on the ship?
Lynn: You don‚Äôt think the king would send you away without an escort, did you? I am here to assist you. From now on, I shall act as your advisor and manservant, as the need arises.
Keith: Oh‚Ä¶ figures they wouldn‚Äôt trust me to be on my own.
Lynn: It‚Äôs not like that at all. Think of me as recompense for your prior banishment.
Keith: Right‚Ä¶
Lynn: Keith, I am sorry about what happened to your fianc√©e. I know Laura meant a lot to you. I remember the way your eyes lit up when I informed you she was on the island.
Lynn: She must have been very special.
Keith: ‚Ä¶yes, she was.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Flora: One sec‚Ä¶ almost‚Ä¶ there!
Flora: You‚Äôre free! How does it feel?
Evals: I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to feel yet. Is this really it? Just like that, I‚Äôm free?
Flora: Well, there are still a few things Trace and Eric have to work out, but basically, yeah!
Flora: Alright, Mike, you‚Äôre up next! Just give me your‚Ä¶ Your wrist and then‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll‚Ä¶
Flora: You could take those off this whole time?!
Mike: Oh, well‚Ä¶ yeah, sure. I mean, they were really loose.
Flora: Well why didn‚Äôt you do that before?
Mike: I wasn‚Äôt supposed to.
Flora: Sigh~!
Mike: Um, I could put them back on if you‚Äôd like‚Ä¶
Flora: No, no, it‚Äôs fine. The moment has passed.
Flora: ‚Ä¶..Natani: There you are! It‚Äôs about time!
Kat: Oh, Natani. Right, sorry, I was‚Ä¶ nevermind.
Natani: Whatever! Just hurry up and shut the door!
Natani: Well, let‚Äôs get this over with, I need something to wear.
Kat: Okay, fine then. We‚Äôll get started. Put that down and lift your arms out.
Natani: Huh? W-why? I‚Äôd rather just stay right over here, if you don‚Äôt mind.Kat: I need to know your measurements before I can make a robe for you.
Natani: I-I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm comfortable getting ‚Äúmeasured.‚Äù
Natani: C-can‚Äôt you just guess? Does it really matter?
Kat: It‚Äôs not going to fit right unless I take measurements!
Natani: Well, I don‚Äôt care if it doesn‚Äôt fit well! I‚Äî
Kat: Oh just take the damn thing off already!!!
Natani: ‚Ä¶
Kat: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry, Natani.
Kat: I don‚Äôt know where that came from.Kat: This will only take a minute. You‚Äôve never had clothes made for you before, have you?
Natani: No. Can‚Äôt say I have. Most of my clothes were handed down from my brother.
Natani: We usually couldn‚Äôt even afford new clothes, much less have them custom made.
Kat: Oh, I didn‚Äôt realize‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a shame. Well, I think you‚Äôll notice a difference.
Kat: Can‚Ä¶ can I ask you something, Natani?
Natani: If you have to.
Kat: What‚Äôs it like out there? You know, in the wild.
Natani: The wild?
Kat: I mean‚Ä¶ what is it like to be a‚Ä¶ a real Keidran?Natani: I‚Äôm probably not the best person to ask.
Natani: I haven‚Äôt exactly lead what you would call a‚Ä¶ typical Keidran life. The wild is not a place a domesticated Keidran like you could survive.
Kat: Really? Why, what happened to you?
Zen: Natani come on!
Young Natani: No!!
Natani: Ngh‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not a time I think about. Look, just be quiet and hurry up with my clothes already!
Kat: I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt realize‚Ä¶ I mean, I‚Ä¶ I just‚Ä¶
Kat: You know what? No. I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm kinda not sorry!
Natani: Eh?
Kat: In fact‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm not sorry at all!
Kat: I‚Äôve been trying to help you and you‚Äôve been nothing but mean to me! But I don‚Äôt have to take orders from you, or anyone else now!
Natani: W-wait!
Kat: If this is how you‚Äôre going to treat me then you can walk around naked for all I care!
Natani: No, wait, come back!
Natani: Stop, please! I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm still kinda freaked out about this whole‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ gender curse‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôre right. I took it out on you.
Natani: If you help me, I‚Äôll tell you about Keidran life. I promise!Kat: Alright, alright. I‚Äôm sorry, too.
Kat: I guess we‚Äôre both a little stressed out tonight.
Kat: Well, I have all the measurements I need for now. I‚Äôll start working on your clothes tomorrow and let you know when they‚Äôre done.
Natani: Okay, great!
Natani: Wait a minute!
Natani: Tomorrow?! I can‚Äôt wait that long!
Kat: Huh? You didn‚Äôt expect me to finish it tonight, did you? It‚Äôs already late. I need to sleep.
Natani: But I can‚Äôt go around like this! How am I supposed to get back to my room!Lynn: Are you sure there isn‚Äôt anything I can do for you, General?
Keith: I told you, I don‚Äôt need anything from you. I‚Äôm just going for a drink.
Lynn: Oh! I can fix drinks for you! Just tell me what you like, and I can make it!
Keith: No! I am perfectly capable of getting a drink for myself.
Keith: I have no need for a servant, I just want to be left alone!
Trace: Keith?
Trace: Hey! Good to see you up and about again! We were getting worried.
Trace: Um‚Ä¶ who were you talking to?
Keith: Oh, I was just‚Ä¶
Keith: Huh? Where did he go?
Trace: Hm?Keith: Er‚Ä¶ nevermind. What are you up to?
Trace: Oh, well‚Ä¶ ever since the island, Flora‚Äôs been acting kinda‚Ä¶ distant with me. She‚Äôs been going to bed early each night and hasn‚Äôt undressed with me around in the last few days.
Trace: I guess what happened at the tower ‚Äî my‚Ä¶ recent outburst ‚Äî scared her.
Trace: I don‚Äôt know.
Trace: But I‚Äôve decided to turn over a new leaf! I‚Äôm going to show her that I care, and I thought I‚Äôd start with breakfast in bed.
Trace: So I‚Äôm down here trying to learn how to cook!
Trace: Unfortunately‚Ä¶ either my cooking skills were lost with the rest of my memories‚Ä¶
Trace: Or I never had any to begin with.Trace: So, how are you feeling, Keith?
Keith: I‚Äôm fine.
Keith: My eyelid was split open, but the eye itself is okay. Right now it‚Äôs swollen shut, but it should heal. My ear‚Äôs damage is mostly superficial, though it‚Äôll probably be left with a permanent crook.
Trace: Well, that‚Äôs good, at least. Listen, if you ever want to talk about‚Ä¶ you know, what happened‚Ä¶
Keith: I said I‚Äôm fine.
Trace: Okay! I understand.
Keith: Sigh‚Ä¶
Keith: By the way, your food is on fire again.
Trace: Gah!!
Keith: If you really want, I could just cook it for you.
Trace: No, no! I appreciate the offer, but I want this to come from me.
Keith: Well, at least let me give you some advice. In case you forgot, Flora‚Äôs a carnivorous tiger. I don‚Äôt think you need to worry too much about cooking the steak.Natani: Phew! Back safe and sound. What a mess. I hope that girl gets those robes finished by tomorrow. I don‚Äôt care what they look like, so long as I‚Äôm covered.
Natani: ‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶I wonder what Keith will think of my new robes?
Zen: NATANI!
Natani: Gah!!
Zen: Listen, the group I‚Äôm tracking finally set camp for the night.
Zen: I think this is my best chance!
Zen: But I want to have every advantage, so I‚Äôd like you‚Ä¶ to‚Ä¶
Zen: SIGH‚Ä¶
Zen: How did you manage to lose your clothes this time?
Natani: I don‚Äôt know! This just seems to keep happening!Zen: (thoughts) Ah, I see what happened now. You‚Äôre lucky that lie worked a second time.
Natani: (thoughts) Yeah, well, the slaves aren‚Äôt all that bright.
Zen: (thoughts) I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ you should be careful with that spotted one. I think she could be more clever than she lets on.
Natani: (thoughts) If you say so. Anyway, what did you need?
Zen: (thoughts) Right, like I said, the group stopped for the night.
Zen: (thoughts) They don‚Äôt have their guard up.
Zen: (thoughts) In fact, they‚Äôve spent most of the day arguing.
Zen: (thoughts) Still, it‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve done a solo mission. I‚Äôd feel better with you watching my back, so to speak. I know that it‚Äôs uncomfortable, but if you could‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Of course, Brother.
Zen: (thoughts) I‚Äôve opened my mind fully to yours. We are now one.
Natani: (thoughts) I‚Äôve opened my mind fully to yours. We are now one.Maren: I can‚Äôt believe we had to sell our dresses for these supplies. I feel like I‚Äôm wearing a burlap sack!
Red: It‚Äôs the best we can do right now. It wasn‚Äôt as though we had time to grab a coin purse while running for our lives.
Maren: Well, why didn‚Äôt you sell that sword of yours? I‚Äôm sure that would have fetched far more coin.
Red: Hey, we need this sword!
Red: These are dangerous times, especially in the wilderness.
Red: Who knows what might be lurking out there! You saw what happened to our village!
Maren: Yes, I know‚Ä¶ I still can‚Äôt believe what happened. The village‚Ä¶ the tavern! All gone.
Karen: But Sis, you always said you hated that tavern.
Maren: Well, yes, but it was MY tavern! It was our family‚Äôs tavern! Our family name is Taverndatter, for crying out loud!
Maren: Why, without the tavern, all I am is‚Ä¶ Maren Datter!Red: Say, where is Raine?
Maren: Raine? I think she went to get some water back at that river we crossed.
Red: What?! She went alone?
Maren: No, of course not, she left with Sythe.
Red: That wolf is with her? That‚Äôs even worse! I‚Äôm going to go make sure she‚Äôs safe.
Maren: Hey wait a minute! What about our safety?
Red: You‚Äôll be fine!
Maren: Erg‚Ä¶ when it comes to Raine, that idiot thinks with the wrong sword. Hey, Karen, have you got that tent up yet?
Maren: Karen? Come on, you can‚Äôt just sleep on top of a half-finished tent! Sigh‚Ä¶ what am I going to do with you guys?Red: (thoughts) Damn it, where are they?
Red: (thoughts) Why would Raine go off alone with him? Doesn‚Äôt she know Keidran are dangerous? He might hurt her!
Red: (thoughts) Erk! Or‚Ä¶ or worse! Clothes‚Ä¶! What is that animal doing with her?!
Red: Huh?
Raine: Come on! You can do it, O‚Äô Mighty Hunter!
Raine: Sure, you may have failed the last 27 times, but 28th time‚Äôs the charm!
Sythe: S-shut up!Red: Hey! What‚Äôs going on over here?
Raine: Oh, hey! We‚Äôre trying to get some fish!
Raine: Since we couldn‚Äôt afford food in town, I figured this was our best chance for dinner. Or it would be, if Sythe could catch any of them!
Sythe: I-It‚Äôs not my fault! It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ too dark. If it was day, I could do this blindfolded.
Raine: But with a blindfold, you‚Äôd see le‚Äî
Sythe: I know what I said, Woman!
Sythe: And you! What are you doing over here, anyway?
Sythe: Why aren‚Äôt you guarding the others?
Red: Maren can take care of herself. But if you‚Äôre so concerned, maybe you should go, and I‚Äôll stay here.
Sythe: Alright, fine, I will then!
Red: Hmph, Keidran.
Red: I tell ya, Raine, you can‚Äôt trust any of them. They‚Äôre not like you or I. Deep down, they‚Äôre animals.Raine: You don‚Äôt really believe that, do you?
Raine: I know why you don‚Äôt like Sythe, but all Keidran?
Red: You saw what they did to our village. They were killing an‚Äô burning everything in their path.
Red: That‚Äôs always the kind of experience I‚Äôve had with Keidran in my life.
Raine: ‚Ä¶Not all Keidran are like that.
Red: Well I guess I can‚Äôt speak for them all. I just know I‚Äôll never be able to trust anybody with fur and a tail.
Raine: I see‚Ä¶
Raine: Well I‚Äôm sorry you feel that‚Äî
Raine: Kyaaa!
Red: Huh? What‚Äôs wrong?!
Raine: I-It‚Äôs nothing! Don‚Äôt look!
Red: You yelled at nothing? Then why can‚Äôt I look?
Raine: It‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ My‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ my top came off!
Red: ‚Ä¶Kinda wanna look now.
Raine: No!Raine: (thoughts) No, no, no‚Ä¶! how can this be happening?!
Raine: (thoughts) Oh no, not the tail too‚Ä¶ I need to get ahold of myself!
Raine: (thoughts) If I just calm down and control my emotions, I can change back. As long as I keep my emotions in check‚Ä¶
Red: So, Raine, I‚Äôve been thinking. I know this isn‚Äôt the best time for it, what with us being on the run and all, but‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve known each other for a while now, and I was wondering if‚Ä¶
Red: Look, you‚Äôre a beautiful woman, and I was wondering if maybe once we‚Äôre no longer running for our lives, you might want to‚Ä¶ I dunno‚Ä¶
Red: ‚Ä¶go do something together?
Raine: (thoughts) Is he‚Ä¶
Raine: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶asking me out?
Red: Raine? Er‚Ä¶ what do you think?
Raine: (thoughts) I think I‚Äôm screwed‚Ä¶Red: Did you hear that?
Red: Someone‚Äôs in trouble. Come on, Raine, I want you close to me.
Raine: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be right behind you‚Ä¶
Maren: AAAAAAAAHHH!!!
Sythe: What the-?
Sythe: Maren?
Sythe: Hang on, I‚Äôm coming!
Sythe: Maren!
Sythe: Maren, what happened? Come on, wake up!
Red: Get your hands off her!
Sythe: Huh?
Red: I knew you couldn‚Äôt be trusted! Keidran‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs only a matter of time!
Sythe: What?! I‚Äôm not responsible for this!
Zen: Ngh‚Ä¶Red: Alright‚Ä¶ If it wasn‚Äôt you, then who?
Red: You‚Äôre the only one with claws around here.
Sythe: I don‚Äôt know, it just wasn‚Äôt me!
Zen: Ngh‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶
Red: Maren! Are you okay? Who did this to you?
Zen: Don‚Äôt listen to him‚Ä¶
Zen: He did it! Came out of no where‚Ä¶ tried to kill me!
Sythe: Maren! What are you saying?!
Red: I knew it! You son of a bitch!
Sythe: Hey, leave my mother out of this!
Red: I‚Äôm going to do what I should have done from the start!
Sythe: Just try it!Raine: Oh no‚Ä¶ not a muzzle, too! It‚Äôs no use, I can‚Äôt stop it! There‚Äôs nothing human left of my body now.
Raine: The shackle‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs broken, and with it‚Ä¶ the suppression enchantment.
Raine: (thoughts) Which means I‚Ä¶ I could be stuck like this! What am I going to do?! There‚Äôs no way I can hide it from them‚Ä¶ and I can‚Äôt will myself to shift back with my emotions like they are.
Raine: (thoughts) I don‚Äôt even know if I can shift back when calm.
Raine: (thoughts) I guess‚Ä¶ I have no choice. I knew I couldn‚Äôt keep it secret forever.
Raine: (thoughts) Maybe it‚Äôs best it comes out now, before‚Ä¶ regrets are made.
Red: I‚Äôll kill you!
Raine: Huh?
Raine: What‚Äôs going on?
Raine: (thoughts) Why are they fighting? And Maren! what happ‚Äî
Raine: GASP!
Raine: (thoughts) That‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not Maren!Raine: NO!!
Zen: (thoughts) Huh? Who said-?
Zen: (thoughts) Wha-! Who the hell is this?!Red: Maren?! No!
Red: Get your filthy hands off her, you flea-bitten wolf!
Raine: Huh?
Raine: No, wait! It‚Äôs me!
Raine: Yip!!Red: Alright, Wolf, where did you come from? Are you two in league with each other?
Raine: I was trying t-to help! Why?! Why did you hurt me?
Red: What are you talking about?
Raine: Maren‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a fake‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs not the real‚Ä¶
Zen: Hey! Don‚Äôt listen to her! She‚Äôs with the wolf! Kill her!
Raine: He‚Äôs speaking in keidran, can‚Äôt you hear it?
Red: No I can‚Äôt, and why should I believe you?
Raine: Don‚Äôt you recognize me?
Raine: You said‚Ä¶ you liked me. You‚Ä¶ you called me beautiful.
Red: Wha? Raine?! Th-that can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶
Zen: Eh?!
Sythe: So, ‚ÄúMaren.‚Äù
Sythe: If you‚Äôre really her, then you should be able to tell us who we are, then.
Zen: Huh?
Red: Yes, if you‚Äôre the Maren I know, tell me, what‚Äôs my name?
Zen: Oh, that‚Äôs easy, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ ah‚Ä¶
Zen: (thoughts) Wait, what is it? They must have said it at some point‚Ä¶
Zen: It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶Red?Zen: (thoughts) I think it‚Äôs time for a tactical retreat.
Natani: (thoughts) We could still take them.
Zen: (thoughts) No.
Zen: (thoughts) We‚Äôre outnumbered, and we‚Äôve lost the element of surprise. And with this new development, we need to reassess the situation for now.
Zen: Well, boys‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been fun. But I think it‚Äôs time I take my leave.
Sythe: Hey! You‚Äôre not going anywhere!
Zen: Hmhm‚Ä¶ Wanna know the great thing about illusions?
Zen: I‚Äôve already left.
Sythe: Ah!
Sythe: Damn it! That little‚Ä¶ Where did she go?!
Raine: Guys, I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt feel so‚Ä¶
Raine: Ungh‚Ä¶
Red: Raine?Natani: Damn it, we almost had them! If only you‚Äôd brought more darts, or a bow, or‚Ä¶
Zen: With what money, Brother? In case you forgot, we failed our last mission. Our only bow went up in flames, and I haven‚Äôt worked in a month. I spent every last coin from this mission‚Äôs advance on those darts and the crystals for your illusions. And even that wasn‚Äôt enough. I had to spend all of last week‚Äôs meal money as well.
Natani: I‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt realize things were so bad.
Zen: I didn‚Äôt want to worry you, so I tried to keep it out of your mind‚Ä¶ literally. But‚Ä¶ things have been rough back home. If we don‚Äôt succeed with this mission‚Ä¶ Well, I‚Ä¶
Zen: But we will! It‚Äôs just the two of them now. The poison in those darts was weak, but without an antidote, they won‚Äôt be waking up again. With two ‚Äî possibly three ‚Äî down, they‚Äôre not going anywhere.
Zen: And I doubt those guys will be getting any sleep tonight.
Zen: So tomorrow, when they‚Äôre exhausted and weak‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll strike!
Zen: But for now, let‚Äôs get some rest.Sythe: Sorry, Raine. I‚Äôm no healer. This is the best I can do for you.
Sythe: Thanks for all the help by the way, ‚ÄúRed.‚Äù
Red: Hey, I dunno nothing ‚Äòbout Keidran or healing. And don‚Äôt call me that.
Sythe: What‚Äôs the matter with you? I thought you cared about her?
Red: I still can‚Äôt believe that‚Ä¶ that thing is Raine. If this was that assassin‚Äôs doing, shouldn‚Äôt it have worn off by now?
Sythe: I don‚Äôt know. Guess we‚Äôll have to wait until she wakes up again to ask.
Sythe: Look, I don‚Äôt like you, and you don‚Äôt like me. I get that. But it‚Äôs just the two of us now, and the girls are counting on us. We‚Äôre going to have to work together if we‚Äôre going to have any hope of living through this.
Sythe: After this is all over, we can go back to hating each other, but until then‚Ä¶ Truce?
Red: ‚Ä¶..
Red: Alright, Furball. Truce.
Red: For now.Trace: Snrrk‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace?
Flora: Hm? Oh, there he is!
Keith: Oh, good morning, Flora.
Keith: Er‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶You‚Äôre up quite early today.
Flora: Yes, well‚Ä¶ When I woke up and saw that Trace hadn‚Äôt come to bed, I was a bit worried.
Keith: I think Trace was hoping he‚Äôd be finished before you were up. He wanted to have breakfast ready for you.
Flora: Aw, poor guy.TwoKinds
9th AnniversaryKeith: So, is everything alright between you two, Flora?
Flora: Huh? Why do you ask?
Keith: Well, Trace seemed to be under the impression that you‚Äôve been acting distant with him lately.
Flora: Oh.
Keith: I can understand if you‚Äôre a little wary because of the hand thing‚Ä¶
Flora: No, no, it‚Äôs not that. It‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs nothing.
Keith: ‚Ä¶Ahuh, right.
Flora: Besides, I should be the one asking you how you‚Äôre doing. After what happened on the island‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry, Keith.
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Flora: We‚Äôre your friends, and we‚Äôre all here for you. If you ever want to talk about it‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Flora: Um‚Ä¶ I ‚Äî I‚Äôm sorry, I shouldn‚Äôt have brought it up.
Keith: SIGH‚Ä¶
Keith: No, it‚Äôs okay. Thank you. I know it‚Äôs something I should talk about. Just‚Ä¶ not right now.
Keith: You know‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve properly apologized to you, Flora.
Flora: A-apologized? What for?Flora: Is this about what happened to Trace on the island?
Keith: No, it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ well, yes, but not just that.
Trace: ZZZ
Keith: There‚Äôs just some things I have to get off my chest.
Keith: After Laura‚Ä¶ I was very bitter towards Keidran. All Keidran. From the very beginning, I‚Ä¶ I said a lot of cruel things to you‚Ä¶ and about you.
Keith: I hated you the first time we met. Because of what you were‚Ä¶ and how much you reminded me of her.
Keith: But being forced to travel with you changed me. It opened my eyes again.
Keith: You made me re-evaluate my opinion of Keidran, and realize what an ass I‚Äôd been.
Keith: I need you to know how thankful I am for that, and how sorry I am for the things I‚Äôve said.
Flora: Keith‚Ä¶Keith: Before Laura‚Ä¶ died, there were so many things I wanted to tell her‚Ä¶ so many things I wish I could have done differently. I wanted to let you know how I felt because‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to leave behind any more regrets.
Keith: Ngh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not making any sense. Just forget I‚Äî
Flora: Keith!
Keith: Eh!
Flora: I understand. And I forgive you.
Flora: What you did before, it doesn‚Äôt matter. You‚Äôre my friend, Keith! Please‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt pull away from us.
Keith: Well‚Ä¶ Um‚Ä¶
Trace: She‚Äôs right, Keith.
Flora: Trace, you‚Äôre awake!
Trace: We all have things in our past we regret. I of all people can relate to that. But we‚Äôre friends. And we‚Äôre here for you. While we can never take back the things we‚Äôve done, together we can try to make it right again.Voice: Keith‚Ä¶
Keith: What?
Keith: L‚Ä¶ Laura?
Flora: Something wrong, Keith?
Keith: Er‚Ä¶ nothing. I gotta go. Thanks for cheering me up. I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fine now!
Flora: Uh‚Ä¶ glad we could help?
Keith: Laura!
Mike: Huh?
Keith: Oh‚Ä¶ Mike. I thought‚Ä¶ I heard‚Ä¶ nevermind. Sorry.
Mike: (thoughts) Did he just call me Laura? Wait, does he think I look like her? Is that why he cursed me with black magic?!
Keith: (thoughts) What‚Äôs with that look?Keith: Well, this has been‚Ä¶ awkward. I‚Äôm just gunna‚Ä¶ leave now.
Mike: H-hey, wait!
Keith: What?
Mike: Um‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶
Mike: (thoughts) Come on, Mike. You‚Äôre a free fox now. Time to stand up for yourself.
Mike: L-look‚Ä¶
Mike: I ‚Äî I know what you did to me! A ‚Äî and‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt ask how I know, but I know it‚Äôs still being done to Natani!
Keith: ‚Ä¶What?
Mike: And‚Ä¶ you shouldn‚Äôt be doing that! It‚Äôs not right, using your black magic on people just for fun.
Keith: (thoughts) Oh, not this again. Why did I ever make up that stupid lie? And what is he talking about? ‚ÄúDid to him‚Äù?
Mike: So I think you should change Natani back and, uh, stop it. Or, erm‚Ä¶ we‚Ä¶
Mike: I mean, if you don‚Äôt mind‚Ä¶
Keith: Sigh‚Ä¶ Alright, fine. I‚Ä¶ promise I‚Äôll go change him back right now. And I won‚Äôt use ‚Äúblack magic‚Äù ever again.
Mike: R-really? Er, I mean‚Ä¶ good.
Keith: (thoughts) Maybe I should go have a talk with Natani anyway.Natani: Um‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm busy right now. Go away!
Keith: Natani, it‚Äôs me.
Natani: Oh, Keith! Uh, just a minute‚Ä¶
Natani: Yes, yes, I know it‚Äôs not ready‚Ä¶ Uhuh‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs only Keith‚Ä¶ S-shut up!
Keith: ‚Ä¶..
Natani: Alright, come in. Just close the door behind you!
Keith: Hey, Natani. I thought we should ta‚Ä¶ N-Natani?!
Natani: Something the matter, Keith?
Keith: You look‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ different.
Natani: Convincing, huh? We‚Äôve been working on it all morning.
Natani: The illusion is still a work-in-progress, but it‚Äôs almost ready.
Natani: I haven‚Äôt run into any major prob‚Äî buh!Natani: Keith!
Keith: Sorry! Sorry! I‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know they were still‚Äî
Natani: It‚Äôs fine! I know you didn‚Äôt mean it. Let‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ pretend that didn‚Äôt happen. Like I said, it‚Äôs still a work-in-progress.
Natani: This isn‚Äôt master-grade magic here. I never took a class in illusion or anything. This is pure make-it-up-as-you-go spellcasting.
Natani: And guesswork magic is very inefficient; burns through what little mana I have quickly.
Natani: These crystals were never meant to be charged over and over like this. But‚Ä¶
Natani: Hopefully it‚Äôll be enough. Mike‚Äôs convinced, but I‚Äôm not so sure about Kat.
Keith: Huh? Kathrin caught you too? What happened? Seems like I missed a lot yesterday.
Natani: Eh, it‚Äôs stupid. My robes went up in flames during the ship fire, and‚Äî
Keith: Fire?! Wait, what fire?
Natani: Oh, right. Man, you really did miss a lot, didn‚Äôt you? Well, I‚Äôm not going anywhere for a while. So if you want, I‚Äôll fill you in while I try to fix these problems.Natani: ‚Ä¶but then I had the idea to suffocate the fire by removing all the air! And it worked!
Natani: Thanks to yours truly, the ship was saved!
Natani: Oh‚Ä¶ and then some other stuff happened and the slaves were set free. but by then my clothes were on fire, so I wasn‚Äôt there for that part.
Natani: Damn it!
Natani: Alright, Zen, how long was that? ‚Ä¶What?! That‚Äôs half a minute less than last time!
Natani: It‚Äôs still too unpredictable!
Keith: Natani‚Ä¶ do you‚Ä¶ want me to leave?
Natani: Huh? ‚Ä¶Oh‚Ä¶
Natani: Sigh‚Ä¶ No. Not unless you want to.
Natani: I knew when I let you in that the spell wouldn‚Äôt last.
Natani: And to be honest‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad for the company. You know, I was worried yesterday, when you didn‚Äôt leave your room at all.
Keith: You‚Ä¶ were?
Natani: Yes! I mean, if you hadn‚Äôt noticed, there‚Äôs not a whole lot of people here I can talk to. You‚Äôre probably the closest thing I have to a friend on this ship.Natani: I guess that‚Äôs kinda sad we‚Äôve tried to kill each other more than once. Right?
Keith: Yeah‚Ä¶
Natani: A-anyway‚Ä¶ If there‚Äôs ever anything I can do for you, I‚Äôm here.
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Keith: Natani‚Ä¶ do you remember when we first met? You and your brother attacked us. You shot me with an arrow.
Keith: But‚Ä¶ right before then‚Ä¶ do you remember what you did?
Natani: Y‚Ä¶ yes?
Keith: Could you do it again?
Natani: Keith‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ Even if I could‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not a good idea.
Natani: I‚Äôm sorry, Keith. I can‚Äôt. Not that.Natani: When my parents died‚Ä¶ one of the reasons I pursued magic was because I wanted to bring them back. I was naive, but I think that‚Äôs why a lot of people get into magic. To change what can‚Äôt be changed.
Natani: Years later, while perfecting the spell, I tried testing it‚Ä¶ on myself.
Natani: But I was so young when I lost them, and it was so long ago.
Young Natani: Mom? Dad?
Natani: They‚Ä¶ they had no face. I couldn‚Äôt remember their faces. Their voices.
Natani: I know it wouldn‚Äôt be the same for you. But‚Ä¶ trust me. It‚Äôs just an illusion made from memories. It‚Äôs not real, and it won‚Äôt make anything any better.
Keith: I know. I don‚Äôt have any delusions about bringing her back.
Keith: I just wish I could say goodbye. Even if it wasn‚Äôt real.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Kat: Come in.
Mike: Hi Kat. I used that key and found the fabrics you asked for, but, um‚Ä¶
Mike: Are you sure about using these materials? This is genuine drake leather and wyvworm silk. This stuff‚Äôs worth a small fortune. I‚Äôm sure Eric had it locked up for a reason.
Kat: Eric?
Kat: Oh, don‚Äôt you worry about him. If anyone gets in trouble, it‚Äôll be me.
Mike: I‚Äôd rather no one be in trouble‚Ä¶
Kat: It‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be lenient with his ‚Äúsister.‚Äù
Mike: O‚Ä¶kay. I‚Äôll just set it here then. What do you need with all this stuff, anyway? I mean, isn‚Äôt it a little overkill for one robe?
Kat: These aren‚Äôt going to just be simple plain old robes, oh no, not when I‚Äôm through with them. These are going to be perfect. When I‚Äôm done, this outfit will be the envy of any mage!
Mike: Kat‚Ä¶ are you okay? Have you been working on this all night?
Kat: Well, I was going to sleep, but then I thought Natani would want these as soon as possible. And what do you mean, ‚Äúokay‚Äù? I‚Äôm fine.
Kat: Can you leave now? I need to concentrate.Trace: Well‚Ä¶ I suppose my breakfast in bed idea was a bit of a bust.
Flora: Aw, sorry about that.
Flora: I could go back to bed and pretend to be asleep if you really want me to.
Trace: Ha, no, it‚Äôs fine.
Trace: And it doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt still treat you!
Trace: Come on, have a seat. Relax!
Flora: Eep!
Trace: I‚Äôll go get your breakfast going!
Flora: Well, thank you, Trace! But‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the occasion?
Trace: No occasion! I just feel like I haven‚Äôt been giving you the attention you deserve, and I intend to correct that!Flora: Well, if you insist! Go my chef! Prepare my royal breakfast!
Trace: As you command, my lady!
Trace: Keith‚Äôs a good teacher ‚Äî I think I‚Äôm really getting the hang of this!
Flora: Hm?
Flora: Nrgh~
Trace: Something wrong, Flora?
Flora: W-wrong? No no! Just‚Ä¶ my stomach growling! Heh heh‚Ä¶
Trace: Well I can fix that!
Flora: (thoughts) I have to tell him. I can‚Äôt keep it a secret forever, and it will only make things worse the longer I wait. But‚Ä¶ how can I explain it to him when I can‚Äôt even explain it to myself? How can he believe I‚Äôve never been with anyone else? And even if he says he does, will he be able to look at me without doubt? What if he doesn‚Äôt even want kids?!
Flora: What am I going to do?!Trace: You know, maybe we should rethink this enchanted mistletoe prank, Flora‚Ä¶
Flora: Aw come on, Trace! It‚Äôs all in good fun! Besides, this spell of yours is too funny to waste! I wonder who we‚Äôll get first?
Trace: Wait, Flora! Someone‚Äôs coming down the stairs!
Flora: Shoot! I almost had it up!
Flora: H-hey guys! What‚Äôs up?
Evals: Hey Flora. We found some of the missing decorations up in the attic.
Flora: Oh, great! I know Maddy was looking for those this morning.
Flora: Well, I‚Äôll let you get back to‚Äî eep!
Flora: Trace!
Trace: Mistletoe made me do it!
[XMAS]Trace: ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do‚Äù about what?
Flora: Eep! Um‚Ä¶ nothing, nothing!
Trace: Are you sure?
Flora: Yes! It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ nothing.
Trace: Well‚Ä¶ alright, if you say so. You know you can always talk to me about anything.
Trace: (thoughts) Sigh‚Ä¶ I can tell there‚Äôs still something wrong. I wish I could get her to open up about it.
Evil Aura: SHE‚ÄôS KEEPING SOMETHING FROM YOU SOMETHING SHE DOESN‚ÄôT WANT US TO KNOW.
Trace: (thoughts) Who‚Ä¶?
Evil Aura: WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS? I KNOW.
Trace: Who‚Ä¶ what are you?
Evil Aura: YOU KNOW WHO I AM. WE WERE ONCE ONE AND THE SAME.
Trace: (thoughts) No! Get out of my head!
Trace: (thoughts) I‚Äôm never going back to the way I was, and nothing you can say to me will change that!
Evil Aura: WE‚ÄôLL SEE.Evil Aura: YOU‚ÄôRE MORE CLUELESS THAN I THOUGHT. YOU REALLY HAVEN‚ÄôT NOTICED? AREN‚ÄôT YOU AT LEAST A LITTLE CURIOUS?
Trace: I told you to leave me alone!
Evil Aura: YOU ALSO SAID NOTHING I COULD SAY WOULD CHANGE YOU.
Evil Aura: YOU‚ÄôRE WRONG. I CAN BREAK YOU WITH JUST ONE IDEA. AND IT IS‚Ä¶
Trace: No! I won‚Äôt listen to you! Do you really think I‚Äôd believe anything you tell me?!
Evil Aura: ASK HER YOURSELF THEN.
Trace: I‚Äôm not doing anything you say! I trust Flora!
Evil Aura: HEHEHEH‚Ä¶ FINE. BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT. SHE WON‚ÄôT BE ABLE TO HIDE IT FOREVER. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE MOMENT WHEN WE ONCE AGAIN SEE KEIDRAN FOR WHAT THEY REALLY ARE. AND WHEN YOUR MIND SHATTERS, I‚ÄôLL BE THERE TO FILL IN THE CRACKS.
Flora: (thoughts) I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve made up my mind. I can‚Äôt keep it a secret any longer. When Trace comes back, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to tell him.Trace: Here‚Äôs‚Ä¶ um, your breakfast, Flora.
Flora: Oh, wow‚Ä¶ It looks‚Ä¶ delicious!
Trace: I know it‚Äôs not exactly a four course meal.
Flora: It‚Äôs fine. This was sweet of you.
Flora: ‚Ä¶ Trace, I‚Ä¶
Trace: Hm?
Flora: I have to tell you something, but I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really scared you won‚Äôt believe me when I do.
Trace: Believe you? Flora, I trust you, and you can trust me!
Flora: I know, Trace, but this is‚Äî
Flora: Madelyn?
Madelyn: Oopsie! my bad.Flora: Maddie, how did you get out of the brig? And why did you knock over my breakfast?
Trace: Gah! All my hard work! Ruined!
Madelyn: I‚Äôm sorry! I was just so hungry. I haven‚Äôt eaten in a long time.
Flora: Aw, it‚Äôs okay. Let‚Äôs get you back and then I‚Äôll send food down.
Madelyn: No, wait!
Madelyn: Please, don‚Äôt send me back to jail! It‚Äôs dark, and wet, and cold!
Flora: I‚Äôm sorry, Maddie, but that‚Äôs not really up to me right now. I‚Äôll talk to Eric about it.
Madelyn: No, not him! He‚Äôs the one that was so mean to me after you left.
Trace: Huh? Eric? What did he do? ‚Ä¶Breakfast Wrecker.
Madelyn: He‚Ä¶ he said I would never be let out of my cell, unless‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶
Madelyn: He said something about paintings, and me taking off my clothes. And then he made weird hand gestures, like‚Ä¶ this!
Flora: He did WHAT?!Flora: I can‚Äôt believe that perv! Actually, no wait, I can. And‚Ä¶ hang on‚Ä¶ Maddie, how old are you?
Madelyn: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm 13. But I‚Äôll be 14 by mid-winter!
Trace: Flora, I forget, do Basitin age like humans or like Keidran?
Flora: Like humans‚Ä¶ That sick bastard!
Flora: Not only is he up to his old tricks, he‚Äôs trying to prey on a child! I‚Äôm giving him a piece of my mind!
Madelyn: Wait! Please, don‚Äôt tell him I told you!
Madelyn: He said he‚Äôd deny everything if I did, and that you‚Äôd never take my word over his.
Flora: Oh, he did, eh? Well, don‚Äôt worry. Trace and I will make sure he can‚Äôt get his hands on you!
Madelyn: D-does that mean I don‚Äôt have to go back to my jail cell?
Flora: No, no you don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll make sure of it! And if he has a problem with that, he can go get stuffed! We can protect you from him.
Madelyn: Oh, thank you! You‚Äôre the best!
Flora: Aw‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs nothing, really.Flora: Trace, would you be so kind as to make something for our new friend to eat? I‚Äôm sure she must be starving.
Trace: Maybe Maddie should make her own ruddy breakfast.
Flora: Trace!
Trace: Or better yet, she can just eat the food off the ground! After all, she put it there!
Flora: Now Trace, you said it yourself, the food‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt really a big loss‚Äî
Trace: Nrgh‚Ä¶ I know! But I still worked hard on it!
Flora: I know you did, dear, and I appreciate it. And I‚Äôm sure Maddie is sorry. Right?
Madelyn: I ‚Äî I‚Äôm really sorry Mr. Trace.
Trace: Argh‚Ä¶ Alright, fine, you two win. Just turn off the puppy-dog eyes.
Trace: And don‚Äôt expect me to work as hard this time around.
Flora: Come on, Maddie, have a seat and let uncle Trace work.
Narration: 10 minutes later‚Ä¶
Trace: Alright, here it is. Enjoy, Squirt.
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶ how‚Ä¶?
Trace: I‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know.Natani: ‚Ä¶
Natani: Alright, You win‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll do it.
Keith: Huh?
Natani: If you feel you really need it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll use my last crystal to cast the heart‚Äôs desire spell on you.
Keith: But what about your disguise spell?
Natani: Sigh‚Ä¶ I guess I can just keep going with the ‚Äúcurse‚Äù excuse for a while longer and pretend I‚Äôm cured later.
Natani: But I warn you‚Ä¶ No matter what it says, or how real it seems, it won‚Äôt be the real Laura.
Natani: It can‚Äôt tell you anything you don‚Äôt already know.
Natani: Are you really sure you want me to do this?
Keith: ‚Ä¶Yes. How long will it last?
Natani: As long as you allow it to. Once I cast the spell, it‚Äôll draw its energy from you, and won‚Äôt stop until you will for it to. That‚Äôs the danger of this magic. The longer it‚Äôs up the more it will drain on you.
Natani: Which is why, once you‚Äôve said your peace, you must let her go. I‚Äôm serious, Keith. Before I do this, I need you to swear to me that you will release it once it‚Äôs all done.
Keith: I know‚Ä¶ I swear. Just begin the spell.Natani: This is a mistake‚Ä¶ I just know it is. I shouldn‚Äôt have relented, but‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a mistake Keith deserves to make for himself. I owe him at least that much.
Natani: It was, after all‚Ä¶ my fault.
Natani: I just hope his lesson‚Ä¶
Natani: ‚Ä¶is not as painful as the one I had to go through.
Laura: Keith‚Ä¶
Laura: I‚Äôve missed you so much.Keith: Laura‚Ä¶
Laura: Keith, why are you crying?
Laura: Everything‚Äôs alright. We‚Äôre together now.
Keith: No‚Ä¶
Keith: We‚Äôre not, and I‚Äôm sorry. Laura, I‚Äôm so sorry.
Keith: I put you in danger. It‚Äôs my fault you‚Äôre gone.
Laura: But I‚Äôm not gone. You brought me back, and we never have to be alone again.
Laura: You saved me. So please don‚Äôt be sad, Keith.
Keith: No, stop it! I didn‚Äôt save you! I couldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ You look and sound just like her, but I know there‚Äôs nothing inside. And that just makes it worse!
Laura: Keith‚Ä¶
Keith: You‚Äôre dead, and it‚Äôs all my fault. I‚Äôm sorry, Laura! I wish I‚Äôd never come back to the island. I wish I‚Äôd never asked you to marry me. I wish‚Ä¶ I wish we‚Äôd never met!
Laura: How‚Ä¶ how could you say that, Keith! D-do you really regret everything we had together? Hearing you say that hurts worse than anything else I‚Äôve been through!Keith: L-Laura?
Laura: Eh?
Laura: W-wait‚Ä¶
Laura: Where am I? H-how did I‚Ä¶?
Keith: What‚Äôs going on?
Natani: I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ not sure. But remember, Keith, It‚Äôs not‚Äî
Laura: Keith!
Laura: Keith! It‚Äôs me! I‚Äôm here, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure how‚Ä¶
Keith: W-what? What do you mean?
Laura: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not really sure. I remember collapsing on the beach, and then‚Ä¶ there was just‚Ä¶ emptiness. I kept feeling like I was supposed to go somewhere, but the magic on the island‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like it was broken. I just kept trying to find you. I could sometimes hear your voice. And then‚Ä¶ I was pulled here, and you were talking to me.
Keith: Is‚Ä¶ is that possible‚Ä¶?
Natani: Keith, it‚Äôs not real! The one in the forest made up things too, remember? You want Laura back so it‚Äôs coming up with any way for it to be possible! You have to let go of it, now!
Laura: Go?! No, please! It‚Äôs me, Keith, I swear it‚Äôs me! D-don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt make me go back.
Laura: Not to t-that‚Ä¶ nothingness. It took so much effort to pull myself back, I don‚Äôt think I can do it again!Natani: Keith, this is not up for debate! It has to go!
Laura: Please‚Ä¶ Keith, don‚Äôt send me away!
Natani: If you don‚Äôt stop it you will die!
Laura: W‚Ä¶ what?
Keith: No.
Keith: I won‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm not letting you go. Not again.
Keith: No matter what happens‚Ä¶ you won‚Äôt be alone this time.
Laura: Keith‚Ä¶
Natani: No‚Ä¶

Chapter Sixteen
ConfessionsRaine: Uurgh‚Ä¶
Sythe: Hey, I think she might be waking up‚Ä¶
Raine: I-is someone there? Erg‚Ä¶ what happened?
Sythe: Hey, Raine. Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre okay. Try not to move around too much. The cut wasn‚Äôt bad, but you lost some blood.
Sythe: Luckily, ‚ÄúRed‚Äù isn‚Äôt as good with a sword as he thinks he is. Still, it probably hurts like a bi‚Äî er, ah‚Ä¶ like heck.
Raine: It does‚Ä¶ but I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be‚Ä¶
Raine: ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm still covered in fur, aren‚Äôt I?
Sythe: Yeeeah, I didn‚Äôt want to start pointing it out or nothin‚Äô, but‚Ä¶ Well, for a human, you‚Äôre looking pretty wolf-ish right now.
Sythe: You‚Äôre probably going to have to explain that one to us at some point.
Raine: Yes‚Ä¶ yes, I know, and I will. Ngh, where are the others?
Sythe: Well‚Ä¶ Maren and Karen‚Ä¶ they haven‚Äôt woken up yet. We‚Äôre not sure what‚Äôs wrong with them.
Sythe: As for Red, he‚Äôs just outside the tent. I think he‚Äôs still in denial.
Raine: ‚ÄúRed?‚Äù‚Äô Who do you keep calling him that?
Sythe: Because it ticks him off, and I think it‚Äôs hilarious! Anyway, I‚Äôll send him in now. And if it‚Äôs any consolation, I think the new look suits you!Red: Hey‚Ä¶ Raine. It‚Äôs me. I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ okay.
Raine: ‚Ä¶..
Red: ‚Ä¶Right. So‚Ä¶
Red: I wanted to apologize for‚Ä¶ hurting you. I didn‚Äôt know you were‚Ä¶ you.
Red: I‚Äôm so used to solving my problems by hitting them until they go away, but‚Ä¶ this time it was a mistake. I‚Äôm sorry.
Raine: I-it‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs my fault. I should have been honest with you.
Raine: Back at the river‚Äî
Red: No, no! I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt tell me at the river! If‚Ä¶ if we were alone and I saw you like that and mistook you for a real Keidran, I don‚Äôt want to think of what I might have done!
Red: But it doesn‚Äôt matter! We‚Äôll fix you, Raine, I promise!
Raine: H-huh? Fix me?
Red: We‚Äôre going to figure out what that assassin did to you, and get you back to your old self in no time. I‚Äôll force that fleabag to change you back myself! I won‚Äôt allow you to be stuck like one of them!
Raine: H-hey, wait!
Raine: He‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt do this to me.
Red: W-what?
Raine: I‚Äôve always been like this. This form‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a part of who I really am?Red: Oh no! It‚Äôs already started to affect your mind!
Red: Raine! Remember who you were! You were a human, not this‚Ä¶ hideous beast!
Raine: Hideous?
Red: Are‚Ä¶ are you remembering? Why are you crying?
Raine: Sorry. I‚Ä¶ I always knew I looked ugly like this. But, it‚Ä¶ still kinda hurts hearing someone say it out loud.
Red: Now hey, w-wait a minute, I didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt look‚Ä¶ that bad. I mean‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ You look pretty good! Ya know, for a lady with the face of a dog.
Red: No, no, wait! That came out wrong too! I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶
Red: D-don‚Äôt cry. Please, let me try again. Just‚Ä¶ look me in the eyes.
Red: It‚Äôs true, this really is you, isn‚Äôt it? But how?
Raine: It‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a long story‚Ä¶ but to really understand, I have to first tell you about my father‚Ä¶ He was a Keidran, but is now called High Templar Euchre.Red: Woah, wait! High Templar Euchre‚Ä¶ is a Keidran? But‚Ä¶ that‚Ä¶ High Templar Euchre is‚Ä¶ a High Templar! That can‚Äôt be true! Raine is a Keidran. Euchre is a Keidran. Who else is a Keidran?! Is the Grand Templar a Keidran? Was King Torval a Keidran?
[‚ÄòRED‚Äô]
Red: Am I a Keidran?! It can‚Äôt be, I would know! What kind am I?
Raine: Huh?
Raine: Hey, relax, relax! You are not a Keidran! Nobody else is a Keidran, okay? It‚Äôs just me and my father.
Sythe: And me. Still Keidran over here.
Sythe: And as much as I enjoy watching you break Red‚Äôs mind, I‚Äôm worried about Maren and her sister. If you‚Äôve forgotten, we still have an assassin hanging over all our heads.
Sythe: Mind if we take this conversation into the other tent?
Raine: Oh, alright. I know a little about medicine.
Raine: I could take a look at them while I explain.
Red: Are you okay to stand?
Raine: Y-yes, I think so. Though, walking with these legs is difficult even when not hurt. Could I‚Ä¶ lean on you?
Red: Oh, uh‚Ä¶ yeah, sure, I guess. Here‚Ä¶
Red: ‚Ä¶..Raine: Even as a young man, my father was gifted in magic. But what made him unique was not his power, but a natural ability that most mages could never hope to learn, let alone master‚Ä¶
Raine: Flawless Transformation.
Raine: Unlike typical illusions, his ability allowed him to physically become human, down to the smallest detail.
Roselyn: Don‚Äôt move, Human!
Euchre: Eek!
Euchre: Rose? Roselyn! I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hot a human! It‚Äôs me, Euchre! Don‚Äôt stab me!
Roselyn: Yeah, I know it‚Äôs you, cousin. I‚Äôm not an idiot. You, on the other hand‚Ä¶ Why do you keep doing this? Sneaking off into that human village is going to get you collared one day. You‚Äôre not as clever as you think you are.
Euchre: Oh no? I certainly seemed to fool the Templar when I applied to join their college in Edinmire.
Roselyn: You‚Ä¶ did what?! Are you insane? Why would you do that?!
Euchre: Rose, you know how much magic means to me. Think of all the knowledge I could gain from them! What the Humans are doing with magic is incredible. They have theories, formulae‚Ä¶ their magic is an art! And their college is the only place I can learn it.
Euchre: Now if you‚Äôll excuse me, I need time to prepare for my inauguration!
Roselyn: When the Templar catch you, the only thing you‚Äôll be getting is an execution!Raine: But Rose was wrong ‚Äî Euchre was not caught. In fact, I‚Äôm told he thrived at the college.
Raine: In Keidran form, Euchre voluntarily arranged to become an indentured servant on a farm at the edge of town.
Raine: This gave him a place to rest outside the college, and legitimized his presence in the village, on the off chance he was ever discovered in his natural form.
Raine: It was at the college that Euchre first met my mother, Mary Silverlock. She was not yet Grand Templar, but was well on her way. I don‚Äôt know much of their relationship. My mother never went into detail, I think it was too painful for her. All I know is that she did not know the truth of Euchre even after they had become intimate.
Red: Hold on! You‚Äôre telling me Euchre never told your mother what he was, even after they started sleeping together?!
Raine: Yeah‚Ä¶ she had no idea.
Red: That‚Äôs kinda messed up.
Raine: From what my mother described, Euchre was a brilliant man, but he was also‚Ä¶ manipulative, and self-serving. I get the impression he would have never told my mother the truth, if it hadn‚Äôt been for‚Ä¶
Trace: Master Euchre! There you are. I was told I could find you in Ms. Silverlock‚Äôs room.
Euchre: Oh, erm‚Ä¶ yes, what is it, boy?
Trace: There‚Äôs a Keidran, Sir. It‚Äôs calling your name from the gallows.Euchre: What‚Äôs going on, Sirus?
Sirus: We caught this Keidran skulking around the edge of the village using an adorable little illusion charm. Unfortunately for her, the town guards saw through it the moment the spy opened her mouth. Quite a strong rural Keidran dialect, you know?
Sirus: Don‚Äôt usually get wolves this far east. Unfortunately, no one on the field right now are familiar enough with them to perform a proper interrogation.
Roselyn: (in Keidran) Euchre?
Roselyn: (in Keidran) Euchre, where are you? Please, help me!
Euchre: I-is this really necessary?
Sirus: Well, I considered holding off until a translator arrived, but this seems easier. Then again‚Ä¶ imagine what kind of things we might learn‚Ä¶
Mary: What‚Äôs going? Euchre, who is this Keidran? Do you know her?
Roselyn: (in Keidran) Euchre?!
Euchre: She‚Ä¶
Roselyn: (in Keidran) Euchre‚Ä¶?
Hangman: We‚Äôre ready. Bring her up.
Roselyn: (in Keidran) No! I don‚Äôt understand! Euchre! Help me! Please!!
Roselyn: (in Keidran) Euchre!Mary: ‚Ä¶
Mary: Hangman, stop.
Hangman: Eh?
Sirus: What? May I ask‚Ä¶ why, Headmistress?
Mary: If this Keidran is a spy as you say, I‚Äôd like to question her. I think she knows something.
Sirus: Well‚Ä¶ if that is what you wish. However, like I said, it will take quite some time in order to find someone who can‚Äî
Mary: I wish to do it myself.
Sirus: Forgive me, but you are not an interrogator, and I know you aren‚Äôt fluent in Keidran. It‚Äôs my duty to handle spies, not yours.
Mary: Thank you, Sirus, but I am head of this college, and I‚Äôll decide for myself what my duties are.
Mary: And as head mage, I have ways of communicating without using words. Now do as I command.
Sirus: ‚Ä¶As you say‚Ä¶ Mistress.
Euchre: ‚Ä¶Mary? I need to be alone right now.
Mary: Euchre‚Ä¶
Mary: You‚Ä¶
Mary: ‚Ä¶Bastard!Mary: You lied to me‚Ä¶ this whole time!
Euchre: I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre t‚Äî
Mary: No! No more lies, Euchre! I questioned Rose. I looked into her mind. She couldn‚Äôt lie to me.
Euchre: R-Rose? Rose is still alive?
Mary: Don‚Äôt pretend to care now! I don‚Äôt know which is more disgusting ‚Äî
Mary: That you never planned to tell me what you really were, or that you were willing to sacrifice your own cousin to make sure it was never found out!
Euchre: I-it‚Äôs not like that! It‚Äôs Sirus! He was trying to trap me ‚Äî to gauge my loyalties.
Euchre: He left me no choice! He knew I couldn‚Äôt be caught connected with a magic-using Keidran.
Mary: You had a choice! You could have run! Taken her and left this place.
Mary: You used her, just as you used me.
Euchre: I never meant for any of this to happen. I wasn‚Äôt trying to use anyone.
Mary: Then why‚Ä¶ why pretend to care about me, if not to use me?
Euchre: I wasn‚Äôt pretending! I‚Ä¶ I just‚Ä¶ hadn‚Äôt planned for it to happen‚Ä¶
Mary: You didn‚Äôt seem to care enough to tell me the truth before bedding me. All that time we spent together‚Ä¶
Euchre: Would it have turned out any better for me if I had? It‚Äôs your people just now who were preparing to murder an innocent girl they simply suspected of being a spy. It might not excuse what I‚Äôve done, but are you honestly surprised I‚Äôd keep what I am a secret from you?Red: Wait, so‚Ä¶ what ended up happening to Roselyn?
Raine: Well, my mother could see in Rose‚Äôs mind that she was not in fact a spy. So, mother sent her back to Keidran territory, on the condition that she never return again.
Red: Oh, I see. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ good. You know‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs strange. I‚Äôve heard lots of stories about the Templar, but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never felt bad for the Keidran before.
Red: I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ glad Rose ended up okay, and that‚Äôs weird to say.
Raine: I guess you‚Äôve never had a reason to empathize with a Keidran before. Though, you should be glad she survived.
Red: Hm? How so?
Raine: Well, you see, while Euchre was at the college, Rose had been with child.
Red: Oh, really?
Raine: Yes. Before I was born, she had a baby boy.
Raine: The child had red hair and bright green eyes. And although she promised not to return, the child eventually ended up at the doorstep of the Templar, where it was raised under a human disguise.
Red: Uh‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ see, R-Raine, what are‚Ä¶
Raine: Tell me, ‚ÄúRed‚Äù ‚Äî Do you happen to have any sort of memento from childhood? Something you‚Äôve had with you for as long as you can remember?
Red: N-no, of course not. I have nothing like that! Nothing‚Ä¶ except for‚Ä¶
Red: Um, well‚Ä¶ this pendant was said to be an old family heirloom‚Ä¶
Red: B-but Raine, this is crazy! You aren‚Äôt honestly suggesting that I‚Äôm somehow‚Äî
Raine: Yes, Red‚Ä¶
Raine: The fact is, you‚Äî
Red: Hey!
Raine: ‚Äîhave secretly been a Keidran all along, just like me!
Red: W-what?! No‚Ä¶ no!
Red: Noooooooo!
Raine: Oh, and that also makes us cousins! So, sorry, Cuz, I‚Äôm off limits!
Red: Nooooooooooo!!!
Narration: Happy April Fools!Red: So, then what happened?
Raine: I don‚Äôt actually know. All I know is that eventually, she let him go.
Red: What? Just like that? Why?
Raine: Well, I can only say what my mother told me. She claimed it was because exposing him might have ruined her chances of being chosen as Grand Templar.
Raine: But‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I believe that. If she really wanted to, I think she could have had him‚Ä¶ ‚Äúremoved‚Äù quietly.
Raine: I think a part of her still loved him, but maybe that‚Äôs naive wishing on my part.
Red: No, I get that. I mean, I grew up an orphan, but I can understand the desire of wanting parents who don‚Äôt hate each other. Though, I gotta say‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt blame your mom if she did.
Raine: Either way, I‚Äôm thankful for my mother‚Äôs mercy. As you‚Äôve probably guessed, by then she was already pregnant with me. It was a shock for everyone.
Raine: My conception was made possible due to my father‚Äôs transformation. However‚Ä¶ the gods do not look kindly on those who thwart their laws.
Mary: Ah!
Raine: I was born cursed ‚Äî I inherited my father‚Äôs gift, but none of his control. I‚Äôm not sure which form I was born with, but I was either a Keidran from birth, or changed soon after, because I‚Äôm told the midwife fainted.
Raine: My existence was kept a secret from almost everyone. A High Templar giving birth to a Keidran would have been a scandal.
Raine: I was given a locket to wear which kept my magic at bay, and then sent to live in a cabin far away from civilization. There were years of my childhood where I wouldn‚Äôt see another soul, save for my caretaker. It was a lonely time in my life.Red: Your mother just‚Ä¶ abandoned you for years? Man, that‚Äôs rough.
Raine: Looking back, I think I understand now. I was a living reminder of what Euchre did. She couldn‚Äôt stand to have me around, but at the same time, I was still family. So she kept me at arms length. It wasn‚Äôt so bad, though.
Raine: My caretaker doubled as my tutor, and once I learned how to read, I spent most of my free time in books.
Raine: You know it‚Äôs kinda funny. I didn‚Äôt even know about my ‚Äúinheritance‚Äù until I was about 12 years old.
Raine: If you think you were surprised, imagine how I felt as a young girl when I accidentally stepped on my locket and began sprouting fur. I‚Äôd never even seen a Keidran before!
Raine: Eeeeeeee‚Äî!
Caretaker: Rainy, what‚Äôs wrong? You haven‚Äôt eaten anything all day. Let me in!
Raine: No! Keep away! I might eat you!
Raine: I remember being terrified, thinking I‚Äôd turned into a werewolf. I guess that‚Äôs not too far off the mark, is it?
Raine: And‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs about it. Years later, Euchre helped Trace lead a coup d‚Äô√©tat against the Templar, in exchange for sparing mother‚Äôs life.
Raine: Trace used a painful, forced version of my father‚Äôs spell ‚Äî Imperfect Transformation ‚Äî to make my mother like me. His idea of a cruel joke, I guess.
Raine: We were sold into slavery by Trace, but secretly released by the man I‚Äôd later learn was my father. Mother enchanted one of my shackles with the same spell as my locket, and then we escaped.
Raine: Ack!
Karen: Look out!
Raine: We became separated while on the run, and‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs when I ran into you guys.Raine: So‚Ä¶ now you know.
Raine: I ‚Äî I‚Äôm sure this must be weird for you. I‚Äôll understand if you don‚Äôt want me around you anymore. I know how much you hate Keidran.
Red: Well, hey now! I never said I‚Ä¶ hated Keidran, necessarily.
Raine: No, I‚Äôm pretty sure you did. In fact, I think it was just the other day‚Ä¶
Red: Tch, Keidran! I hate them all. Why can‚Äôt the Templar just get rid‚Äôa the lot of them?
Red: Well, okay! I said that. But‚Ä¶ I, uh, didn‚Äôt really mean it‚Ä¶
Raine: Uhhh‚Ä¶
Red: I really mean it! Every last one of them. Especially the wolves!
Red: Okay, okay! Damn it, past me, stop making current me look bad. Erg, this is so confusing.
Raine: Sorry‚Ä¶
Red: You don‚Äôt have to apologize. I‚Äôm just not used to‚Ä¶ thinking about the stuff I say.
Red: Alright‚Ä¶ yes, I admit it, I‚Äôve never liked Keidran. They‚Äôre always, ya know‚Ä¶ burning down my whole village and stuff like that.
Red: But I don‚Äôt hate you personally, Raine. I guess you can‚Äôt really help being what you are, can you?
Sythe: Hey, what about me? I can‚Äôt help being a Keidran either, but you still act like a jerk to me over it.
Red: No one cares about you, Sythe.
Sythe: SIGH~
Sythe: I know‚Ä¶Red: Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, this is still pretty weird for me. A week ago, I could hardly stand to be in the same room with a Keidran, and now I‚Äôm sitting right next to one having a casual conversation while her tail is hitting my leg.
Raine: O-oh! Sorry! I‚Äôve always had trouble controlling that thing. But you know, I still consider myself human‚Ä¶ I know I don‚Äôt look it right now, but I spent my whole life raised as such.
Raine: I‚Äôm still the same ‚ÄúRaine‚Äù you always knew.
Red: Oh, yeah, of course! I know, I‚Äôm just saying‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs probably going to take me a while to get used to this. I know in my head who you are, but‚Ä¶ seeing a Keidran, my body‚Äôs first reaction is still ‚Äúenemy.‚Äù
Sythe: Yeah, I‚Äôll say. He drew his sword on me three times during the night saying I had ‚Äúfinally turned on him.‚Äù But ya know, as much as I enjoy seeing Red actually question his actions for once, can we please focus on healing the girls? We‚Äôve still got an assassin out there.
Raine: Right! Where is he, anyway? Why hasn‚Äôt that guy tried attacking us again?
Sythe: He doesn‚Äôt have to. He knows while there are two of us down, we can‚Äôt go anywhere. No point taking a risk and fighting us all at once when he can just wait it out. There‚Äôs only us three, and we can‚Äôt leave the girls alone, so we either split up or we starve.
Sythe: This guy is devious‚Ä¶ a real professional. He‚Äôs probably watching us right now, just waiting for the perfect time to strike.
Zen: Snnnnrrrk!Natani: (thoughts) Zen? Hey, Zen! Wake up, ya lazy sod! I need your help! Grrr‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs getting better and better at blocking my mind.
Natani: (thoughts) Either that, or our connection is‚Ä¶ no, it‚Äôs fine. Maybe we‚Äôve been separate for too long.
Natani: Kat! Are you in there? Open up, woman!
Kat: Natani? W-wait, just a minute!
Natani: Kat! I need my robes!
Kat: What? Robes? No, no, they‚Äôre not ready yet!
Natani: You said you‚Äôd have them ready today!
Kat: No! I said I‚Äôd start them today! I can‚Äôt make a whole outfit overnight!
Natani: ‚ÄúA whole outfit‚Äù?! All I asked for was simple robes!
Kat: Well, I ‚Äî I may have gotten a little ambitious.
Natani: Agh! Listen, I don‚Äôt have time for this! Keith‚Äôs life is in danger! I have to get help from the others, but I can‚Äôt go out in a sheet!
Kat: I don‚Äôt get it, Natani, what‚Äôs the big deal? So what if you look like a woman!
Natani: Hey, shush! Not so loud!
Kat: If Keith really is in danger, what does it matter what the others think about you?
Natani: It‚Ä¶ it matters to me.
Kat: Look, if you want my help, I want to know the truth.
Natani: W-what do you mean?
Kat: There‚Äôs no such thing as Basitin black magic, is there?Natani: N-no Basitin black magic? How‚Ä¶ er, what gives you that idea?
Kat: Natani, please, I‚Äôm really tired and cranky. If you want my help, just be honest with me. I‚Äôm not going to judge you, Natani, but don‚Äôt lie.
Natani: Well, you see‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt understand, it‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶
Natani: A-alright, fine. The truth. There‚Äôs no Basitin magic, Keith was just covering for me.
Natani: But the‚Ä¶ way I am is the result of black magic! It was just years ago‚Ä¶
Kat: Really? How? That‚Äôs not another ‚Äúcover‚Äù, is it?
Natani: No, no, that‚Äôs true! (partially) But I don‚Äôt have time to go through my whole life story! Keith, danger, remember?
Kat: Well, you had time to come to me. What‚Äôs the matter with him?
Natani: He‚Äôs not in immediate danger, but‚Ä¶ a spell I cast will kill him eventually unless the others can help me talk sense into the stubborn idiot!
Kat: What?! Why would you do that to him?
Natani: I wasn‚Äôt trying to hurt him on purpose! It‚Ä¶ it was a mistake.
Natani: ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt want Keith to die because of me.
Kat: I see‚Ä¶ well, there‚Äôs no way I can finish your robes today, but I think I can scrap together something to at least cover up your‚Ä¶ figure. I‚Äôll need an hour minimum, though. And in return, you tell me your story. The true one, okay?
Natani: ‚Ä¶Fine.
Natani: (thoughts) Damn it, Keith. After I finish saving your life, I‚Äôm going to kill you for this.Keith: ‚Ä¶and then they called me into the court. I didn‚Äôt even care about being banished again.
Laura: Keith‚Ä¶
Keith: But it turns out, Alaric had planned for this all along! I was made a general! I‚Äôm still not sure how that even happened.
Laura: Keith, what did she mean?
Keith: They even gave me my own armor! I‚Äôll show you!
Keith: I think it‚Äôs‚Äî
Laura: Keith! Stop ignoring me!
Keith: Huh? I‚Äôm not!
Laura: Then tell me what Natani meant! Why did she say you‚Äôd die?! I-is that how I‚Äôm still here? Am I killing you?
Keith: Laura, relax, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fine! Everything‚Äôs fine. COUGH! Don‚Äôt worry about it.
Laura: No! I can‚Äôt! Y-you can‚Äôt do this, Keith! If me b-being here is hurting you, you have to‚Ä¶ s-send me back!
Keith: Laura, you begged me not to moments ago!
Laura: That was before I knew it would mean you would d-die!
Keith: All the more reason! You were terrified when Natani said you had to go back! I know those were your true feelings. Besides, I feel fine! Maybe Natani is wrong. There‚Äôs no way to know how the spell will affect a Basitin.
Keith: Laura, please. I need this. You don‚Äôt know what the last few days have been like for me. I know this is selfish, but I just want to be happy, even‚Ä¶ if it won‚Äôt last.
Laura: Keith‚Ä¶Keith: Listen to me, Laura. I know you want to stay here just as much as I want it. You travelled across the ocean and to the edge of the world just to find me. You deserve to be happy. We both do. So please, don‚Äôt worry.
Laura: I can‚Äôt help it. H-how can you even be sure that I‚Äôm really‚Ä¶ me?
Laura: I-I mean, I know I am, but what Natani sa‚Äî mmmph!
Keith: Forget what Natani said.
Keith: I know it‚Äôs you, Laura. No amount of imagination could replace you.
Keith: You are real. I don‚Äôt know how, and I don‚Äôt care. I won‚Äôt abandon you again. I‚Äôll find help. One of my friends must be able to do something.
Keith: I‚Äôll do whatever it takes to save you. So please, don‚Äôt worry. Let‚Äôs just enjoy the time we have.
Laura: B-but‚Ä¶ O-okay, Keith. I‚Äôll try, for you, if‚Ä¶
Laura: ‚Ä¶if that‚Äôs really what you desire.Madelyn: Mmph! ‚ô•!
Flora: Admit it, Trace. She‚Äôs a cute kid.
Trace: I suppose. In a manipulative sort of way.
Flora: ‚Ä¶Say, Trace.
Trace: Hm?
Flora: Have you ever thought about‚Ä¶ having kids?
Trace: K-kids? Er‚Ä¶ no, I‚Ä¶ hadn‚Äôt really considered it.
Trace: Honestly, I kinda figured ‚Äúno kids‚Äù was a foregone conclusion once I decided to start dating outside of my own species, you know?
Trace: Why do you ask?
Flora: Um, well‚Ä¶ I just need to know, it‚Äôs important. If it were somehow possible for us‚Ä¶ would you want that?
Trace: I‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know. If I‚Äôm honest‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôd probably be the worst father ever. I have about six months worth of life experience and about two decades worth of stuff I can‚Äôt remember.
Trace: Everyone in the world either hates me for things I did or wants me to go back to the way I was before. Including an evil black smoke hallucination which I think might be my past self trying to reassert itself.
Trace: So yeah, I‚Äôm not exactly father materia‚Äî
Flora: Wait, wait, back up.
Flora: ‚ÄúEvil black smoke hallucination?‚ÄùTrace: Oh, yeah, well‚Ä¶ It only happened once this morning while I was cooking breakfast.
Trace: I‚Äôll be honest, a freaky voice in my head is pretty unnerving, but I‚Äôm hoping it was just that once.
Trace: And I didn‚Äôt listen to it, obviously! I might be a little naive, but its attempts at manipulating me were transparent.
Flora: Manipulating? What do you mean? What did it say?
Trace: Well, it seemed to think you were keeping something from me. And that when you told me what it was, that would somehow make me go back to my ‚Äúold ways.‚Äù
Trace: So you see, it‚Äî wha‚Äî?! Hey! Don‚Äôt be like that, Flora! I would never do that!
Trace: Besides, it‚Äôs not like you really are keeping some life-changing secret from me anyway. ‚Ä¶R-right?
Trace: ‚Ä¶Oh.
Trace: W-well, that‚Äôs okay! I‚Äôm sure whatever it is, I‚Äôll understand!
Trace: There‚Äôs absolutely nothing you could tell me that‚Äôll just make me flip out, I swear! Hey, maybe if I just guess, it‚Äôll, um‚Ä¶ soften the blow.
Flora: No, Trace, wai‚Äî
Trace: Is it your health? Y-you‚Äôre not dying are you?!
Flora: No, no! I‚Äôm fine. Listen to me‚Äî
Trace: Is‚Ä¶ is it about our relationship?
Flora: W-well, yes, sort of‚Ä¶
Trace: Is it‚Ä¶ t-that you want to start seeing other p‚Äî
Flora: No! It‚Äôs not that! Please, no more guessi‚Äî
Madelyn: Is it that you‚Äôre gunna be a mama tiger?!Trace: Sigh‚Ä¶ Look, Kid, I appreciate that you‚Äôre trying to help, but this is an adult conversation. We don‚Äôt need your silly, nonsensical suggestions. Now come on, out! We‚Äôll figure out what to do with you after we‚Äôre done talking!
Madelyn: Aww‚Ä¶ I was just trying to help!
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶
Flora: She‚Äôs right.
Trace: ‚ÄúRight‚Äù? A-as in‚Ä¶ correct? But she‚Ä¶ she was implying that‚Ä¶ you were‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace. I‚Äôm pregnant.
Trace: Snerk!
Trace: Ahahaha! Wow, you two really had me going there for a second! Did you two plan this out from the beginning or did y-_eeeeeee-!_
Flora: Trace, you promised not to freak out. I consider falling unconscious to be a form of freaking out. ‚Ä¶Trace?Flora: Trace, are you alright?
Trace: Yeah ‚Äî I mean no! I mean‚Ä¶ when? How?!
Flora: I don‚Äôt know! I really have no idea! I only found out the day we left the island, and even then, I wasn‚Äôt sure I believed it! I just always assumed it wasn‚Äôt possible between a human and a Keidran!
Evil Aura: THAT‚ÄôS BECAUSE IT ISN‚ÄôT POSSIBLE.
Flora: That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been so distant with you lately, and wearing this all the time. I didn‚Äôt want to keep it a secret, but I had no idea how to explain it!
Evil Aura: SHE‚ÄôS LYING‚Ä¶
Flora: T-Trace, I know how it might seem, but I swear! I‚Äôve never been with anyone else since I‚Äôve been with you!
Evil Aura: YOU KNOW WHAT SHE‚ÄôS SAYING IS IMPOSSIBLE. SHE‚ÄôS BEEN SLEEPING BEHIND YOUR BACK.
Flora: I-I‚Äôm telling the truth! T‚Äî
Evil Aura: OH, I‚ÄôM SORRY. AM I SPEAKING OVER HER WORDS? THEY AREN‚ÄôT IMPORTANT ANYWAY. DO YOU SEE NOW WHY KEIDRAN CANNOT BE TRUSTED. NO MATTER HOW HUMAN THEY SEEM, THEY ARE ANIMALS. MAYBE IT WAS THE WOLF? SHE WAS ALL OVER HIM AT THAT FESTIVAL, REMEMBER? IT‚ÄôS NO SURPRISE SHE‚ÄôD BEND OVER FOR HI‚Äî
Flora: ‚Äî I‚Äôm scared. Please, Tr‚Äî
Trace: Shut up!!Flora: W-why‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶ not you. I thought if anyone would believe‚Ä¶
Trace: Flora!
Trace: I‚Äôm not angry. Not at you.
Flora: You‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not?
Trace: No, of course not! Listen to me.
Trace: I know you. You don‚Äôt have to explain yourself to me ‚Äî or to anyone else for that matter! If you say it‚Äôs the truth, then I believe it!
Flora: Y-you do? Really?
Trace: Yes, I do.
Flora: And you‚Äôre not just saying that?
Trace: No, like I told you before, I trust you. Really.
Flora: Thank you! You have no idea how much of a relief that is to hear!
Flora: Although, you didn‚Äôt have to tell me to shut up like that‚Ä¶
Trace: Sorry, that wasn‚Äôt directed at you.
Flora: ‚Ä¶Smoke hallucination?
Trace: Right. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. It doesn‚Äôt know me, much less you.Evil Aura: THIS ISN‚ÄôT OVER.
Trace: (thoughts) Yes, it is. I‚Äôm the only one in control of my thoughts.
Evil Aura: FOR NOW‚Ä¶
Flora: That smoke thing still worries me. Is it still talking to you?
Trace: It was, but I think it‚Äôs gone now.
Flora: Oh, good. I‚Äôm glad.
Flora: I know I said it before, but it‚Äôs such a relief to finally be open with you again, even though I‚Äôm still unsure how it‚Äôs possible. I think the stress was starting to make my fur fall out. ‚Ä¶Or maybe I‚Äôm just shedding my summer coat. Either way, it was making a mess of our bed.
Trace: Yeeeah, I wasn‚Äôt going to mention it‚Ä¶
Flora: And speaking of the bed, I‚Äôll finally be able to sleep without wearing this thing! I can‚Äôt tell you how frustrating that‚Äôs been!
Flora: With our fight on the island, and then me avoiding you ever since, it feels like it‚Äôs been forever since we just‚Ä¶
Flora: Just‚Ä¶
Flora: Actually, know what, Trace? Bed sounds pretty good right now. I think I‚Äôll head back there now.
Trace: Huh? But it‚Äôs still morning. We just got up two hours ago.
Flora: Suit yourself. But if you need me, you‚Äôll know where to find me. On the bed.
Trace: ‚Ä¶Oh. Oh!
Trace: Right, uh, stay out of trouble, Squirt. We‚Äôll be back‚Ä¶ later.
Madelyn: Huh? Strange time to sleep‚Ä¶Narration: Meanwhile, a few rooms over and an explanation later‚Ä¶
Natani: And‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs about it‚Ä¶ I guess.
Kat: Wow, Natani. I had no idea. Thank you for being honest with me.
Natani: Yeah, well, you kinda blackmailed me. It‚Äôs not like I had a lot of choice.
Kat: I‚Äôm sorry. I know now why you‚Äôre so uncomfortable with people knowing. I understand very well the desire to not be judged by how you look. We‚Äôre more alike than you might think, in that regard.
Natani: ‚Ä¶How so?
Kat: I don‚Äôt look like this by accident, you know. I was bred this way. As were my parents, and theirs, and so on. I know what kind of expectations people have about me.
Kat: It doesn‚Äôt help that they‚Äôre right ‚Äî it‚Äôs exactly what I was bred for. So I understand.
Kat: And since you‚Äôve told me a secret, I‚Äôll tell you one of mine. There‚Äôs a reason why canines and felines aren‚Äôt often bred together. I‚Äôm infertile. I cannot go into heat. I‚Äôll never have children of my own.
Natani: Oh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry.
Kat: It‚Äôs alright. It‚Äôs thanks to that I was allowed to be sold to Eric, after all. I can‚Äôt imagine where I‚Äôd be right now otherwise.Natani: Man, now I feel like a real asshole, sitting here complaining to you about my perfectly functional lady bits. Care to trade?
Kat: Hahah‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt suppose you have a spell for that?
Natani: No, but if I ever find one, you‚Äôll be the first to know. I‚Äôm certainly never going to use mine. And believe me, you‚Äôre not missing anything when it comes to estrus. It‚Äôs the one thing I hate most about being stuck in a woman‚Äôs body.
Natani: It‚Äôs the only time  where I feel like I‚Äôm being controlled by my body, and not the other way around. I‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt like being controlled.
Kat: I hadn‚Äôt thought of it like that. I‚Äôm sorry. That must be awful.
Natani: Yeah, well, thankfully my brother‚Äôs always been there for me; making sure I didn‚Äôt do anything stupid I‚Äôd regret. That first year was bad, though. We‚Ä¶ hadn‚Äôt learned to completely block each other out yet.
Kat: Oh‚Ä¶ wow‚Ä¶ poor guy.
Natani: ‚ÄúPoor guy‚Äù?! He only had to deal with it once! _This guy‚Äôs_had to deal with it his whole adult life!Natani: Are you almost done? I feel bad enough waiting even this long.
Kat: Just about. Just need to make sure this doesn‚Äôt fall apart like last time.
Natani: Okay, good. As I said, Keith‚Äôs not in danger of just dropping dead or anything, but‚Ä¶
Natani: I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôll take to make him see reason.
Kat: You really care about him, don‚Äôt you?
Natani: W-what do you mean? Of course‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre‚Ä¶ friends. And I owe him a debt. That‚Äôs all there is to it!
Kat: A debt, hm?
Natani: Yeah. You probably already guessed, but Keith‚Äôs been covering for me.
Kat: I assumed so, from all the talk of ‚ÄúBasitin black magic.‚Äù
Kat: And there was also that time I caught the two of you in the baths together. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but in hindsight‚Ä¶
Natani: H-hey! That was a misunderstanding! We ended up in the same bath by accident! And he was washing my back! It wasn‚Äôt what it looked like! I don‚Äôt even know why I let him‚Äî
Kat: Woah woah woah! I wasn‚Äôt implying you two were doing anything! I just meant it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôd known then.
Natani: Oh‚Ä¶ Right‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶
Natani: Anyway, Keith‚Äôs stuck his neck out for me a lot. He protected me when I wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ in control. He even risked his own life for me. And what have I ever done for him in return?Natani: Ugh‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm talking about this stuff. I was never so mushy with Zen around.
Kat: Well, you‚Äôre in luck! The robes are finished!
Kat: So, you won‚Äôt have to put up with all this ‚Äúgirl talk‚Äù for much longer.
Natani: ‚Ä¶You know, I really hate to admit it, but‚Ä¶ This‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt as terrible as I‚Äôd imagined it.
Natani: I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong. This has been‚Ä¶ weird. But‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs kinda nice to be able to talk about this‚Ä¶ girly stuff.
Natani: My brother‚Äôs ‚Äî erk! ‚Äî great. He‚Äôs always been supportive, but‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs just some stuff I can‚Äôt talk to him about!
Natani: Like‚Ä¶ these things! When they started‚Ä¶ becoming a problem, Zen just pretended like they didn‚Äôt exist.
Natani: I don‚Äôt blame him. But I couldn‚Äôt ignore them like he did. And‚Ä¶ sigh, I‚Äôm just rambling now.
Kat: No, no, I understand. I‚Äôm guessing you haven‚Äôt had a lot of women in your life.
Natani: Not really.
Kat: Well, I know we need to go help Keith, but‚Ä¶ After this is all over, if you ever feel like you need more ‚Äúgirl talk‚Äù‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be here.
Natani: ‚Ä¶Thanks, Sp‚Äî Kathrin. I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ think about it.Natani: These‚Ä¶ are my robes?
Kat: W-wait! I know they aren‚Äôt very good, but please remember, they aren‚Äôt the final version!
Natani: No, no, they‚Äôre nice! I can‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôve had something that actually fit me right.
Natani: Thanks, Kat. These are great.
Kat: Oh, you‚Äôre welcome! I-it was nothing, really. The vest was mostly done. All I did was modify your old robes into some pants and a cloak.
Natani: Well, they work! Now, let‚Äôs get going!
Kat: O-oh, right. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ right behind you, Natani.
Natani: Hey! Where is everybody?! Hello? Stripes? Hey, I need to borrow your pet human.
Natani: You in h‚Äî woah, what the‚Ä¶?
Natani: Who in the world did that?!Madelyn: Hey there, Mr. Wuffypants!
Madelyn: Watcha doin‚Äô?
Natani: Wha-?! Who are you?! Where did you come from?
Madelyn: Don‚Äôt you remember? We‚Äôve met twice before.. I‚Äôm Lt. Madelyn Adelaide! But you can call me Maddie for short. Or Madness for long!
Natani: Oh, right‚Ä¶ you. The one who wrote that heart-filled letter. What are you doing here?
Madelyn: I was sent with you guys to act as a military escort. From now on, Keith and I are going to be very close!
Natani: Y-you?
Natani: Now listen Pipsqueak, Keith doesn‚Äôt need you, he‚Äôs got me!
Natani: T-to protect him!
Natani: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶Just as soon as I stop killing him.
Natani: Gah! I don‚Äôt have time for this! Where is everyone? I need them here!
Madelyn: You do? Hm‚Ä¶ oh! I think I know a way to get everybody‚Äôs attention!
Natani: How‚Äôs that?
Madelyn: Just watch!Flora: SIGH‚Ä¶
Flora: I‚Äôve missed this. ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm still surprised how well you‚Äôve been taking the news.
Trace: Well, don‚Äôt get me wrong, Flora‚Ä¶
Trace: ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm still kinda freaking out about the whole ‚Äúbeing a dad‚Äù thing.
Trace: But it‚Äôs the normal kind of freaking out, I think. Not the‚Ä¶ crazy evil type.
Flora: Good! I don‚Äôt care much for that one.
Trace: Actually, I‚Äôve been thinking about this whole situation, and I figure‚Ä¶ A lot of people can‚Äôt read or write, right?
Trace: So maybe it isn‚Äôt as impossible as everyone thinks. Maybe hybrids are just so rare that they‚Äôve gone undocumented?
Flora: It must be‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm not sure if the others will accept that. It‚Äôs common knowledge that humans and Keidran can‚Äôt breed.
Flora: What if they all think I‚Äî
Trace: I told you, I don‚Äôt care what anyone thinks!
Trace: If they can‚Äôt accept it, then it‚Äôs their problem. Come on, let‚Äôs not worry about what might happen.
Flora: You‚Äôre right, Trace. Let‚Äôs just enjoy the peace we have right now. I‚Äôm just glad there‚Äôs nothing else for us to be worried about.
Flora: Why! Why did I say that out loud?!Flora: Well, we‚Äôd better check it out. That crash sounded like it came from the kitchen, and Eric‚Äôs sure to have heard it.
Trace: Yeah, I suppose. Hey, aren‚Äôt you going to get dressed first?
Flora: Oh! Right‚Ä¶
Flora: Actually, you know what? I think I‚Äôm good. They have to find out sometime, and you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs not worth the stress of keeping it secret.
Trace: I think that‚Äôs a good idea. As long as you‚Äôre sure.
Flora: I‚Äôm sure. I‚Äôve been wearing them for a while, anyway. They were getting a little rank, to be honest.
Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Kat: (in Keidran) Natani! I heard a crash, is everything‚Äî What did you?!
Natani: (in Keidran) Wha‚Äî? Me?! I didn‚Äôt do anything! It was her ide‚Äî W-where did she go?! She was right here!Mike: Hey, we heard a crash! Wha‚Äî woah!
Mike: Natani smashed up the kitchen!
Evals: Alright! Way to go, Natani! Fight the power!
Eric: (in Human) Hey, what the heck is going on in here?!
[HOW TO TRAIN YOUR KEIDRAN]
Evals: (in Human) It was him.
Natani: (in Keidran) I already said I didn‚Äôt do it! And this isn‚Äôt important right now!
Eric: GASP!
Eric: That vest!
Eric: (in Keidran) That‚Äôs my material! You stole it! Take it off, now!
Natani: (in Keidran) I didn‚Äôt steal anything! And if you touch me again I‚Äôll break off your hand and beat you to death with it!
Kat: Leave him alone, Eric! I gave it to him!
Eric: You did what?!Eric: Kat! How could you?! You have no idea what that material was worth!
Kat: I knew exactly how much that material was worth, Eric! I‚Äôm not as dumb as you might think if you bothered to notice!
Eric: What?!
Kat: So if you‚Äôre going to yell at anyone, it should be me!
Kat: But after all, what‚Äôs yours is mine, isn‚Äôt that right, Brother?
Eric: That doesn‚Äôt excuse you from taking my things without asking me! What‚Äôs gotten into you, Kat? We‚Äôre going to have to have a talk later about this.
Eric: But for right now‚Ä¶
Eric: (in Keidran) Listen here, Wolf! I‚Äôm captain of this ship and I don‚Äôt appreciate being threatened! Now those robes were not Kat‚Äôs to give, so either you pay for the damage or you hand them over!
Flora: H-hey!
Flora: What‚Äôs with all the yelling, you guys? Did something happen?
Flora: ‚Ä¶What?Eric: Wait! Flora, you‚Ä¶ are you‚Ä¶?
Kat: Eric! Don‚Äôt go being mean to her now, too! She‚Äôs just a bit pudgy! And she doesn‚Äôt like it when people go pointing it out!
Flora: Hey! I‚Äôm not ‚Äúpudgy‚Äù!
Kat: See?
Natani: (in Keidran) Would you all just shut up so I can explain?! And talk normal! I can‚Äôt understand your human gibberish!
Natani: (in Keidran) You! Stripes! I need your human! And you have to translate for me!
Flora: (in Keidran) My human? For what?
Eric: (in Keidran) Hey! We aren‚Äôt finished here, wolf!
Natani: Grrr‚Ä¶
Eric: (in Keidran) Either you give up those materials, or I‚Äôll have you put in the brig!
Natani: (in Keidran) I‚Äôd like to see you try, human!
Eric: (in Keidran) This is my ‚Äî it‚Äôs my rules!
Flora: Listen, I‚Äôm really not tubby, I swear‚Äî
Kat: You can‚Äôt just take back my gift‚Äî
Eric: (in Keidran) I‚Äôm giving you until the count of three‚Ä¶
Trace: Flora, what are we yelling about?
Madelyn: Rabble rabble!
Keith: HEY!
Keith: What‚Äôs going on?
Laura: Your friends are scary‚Ä¶Trace: (in Human) Laura?! That‚Äôs impossible! You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ I saw you‚Ä¶
Mike: (in Human) I-it‚Äôs a ghost! The ship is haunted!
Evals: Oh gods, no! Ghosts on a ship are bad luck! The Na‚ÄôRella is doomed!
Natani: It‚Äôs not a ghost! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been trying to explain! She‚Äôs an illusion ‚Äî a spell that creates your heart‚Äôs desire, while leeching away your life in exchange. And if it‚Äôs not taken care of, it‚Äôs going to end up killing him!
Keith: Shut up, Natani! Don‚Äôt talk about her like that! Laura is not an ‚Äúit‚Äù! She‚Äôs real!
Natani: He‚Äôs only saying that because he desperately wants it to be true! Of course the fake would say it‚Äôs real! Flora, tell your human to dispel it!
Keith: She‚Äôs not a fake! I know Laura. I can tell!
Flora: But Natani‚Ä¶ what if Keith‚Äôs right? We‚Äôve seen ghosts before. What if it really is Laura?
Natani: That‚Äôs not the point! Are you people listening? Keith‚Äôs going to die! And ghost or illusion, Laura. Is. Dead!Keith: I‚Äôm not letting you take Laura away from me again, Natani! Why won‚Äôt you just leave us alone? What do you have against her?
Laura: Keith‚Ä¶
Natani: ‚ÄúWhat do I‚Äî‚Äù? ‚ÄúAgain?!‚Äù
Natani: RRRGH!
Natani: I‚Äôm doing all of this for you, ya moron! And you know it!
Keith: Well I never asked you to! So why can‚Äôt you just leave me in peace?!
Natani: Because I care about you, you idiot! Do you really think what happened at the tavern meant nothing to me? Well it did! And you know how hard it is for me to say stuff like this ‚Äî especially in front of everybody! But‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I need you, okay?! You‚Äôre the best friend I have on this stupid boat!
Natani: And right now, you need me, too. I won‚Äôt let you destroy yourself, even if it means you hating me!Keith: Ngh‚Ä¶
Keith: Natani!
Keith: I‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶I know.
Keith: I know‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm sorry.
Keith: I shouldn‚Äôt have said that. I don‚Äôt blame you, I just‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt give up on Laura‚Ä¶ again. I just can‚Äôt! Not if there‚Äôs a chance‚Ä¶
Flora: Alright, look, let‚Äôs all just‚Ä¶ calm down now. Natani, you‚Äôre right, we have to do something about this, but it would help if we knew exactly what we‚Äôre dealing with. Maybe there‚Äôs some way to prove one way or another what she really is.
Natani: But there isn‚Äôt! None of us knew Laura except Keith, and it‚Äôs going to act just like he expects!
Flora: Well, wait, how exactly does this spell of yours work?
Natani: Like I said, it‚Äôs a heart‚Äôs desire spell. It takes your memories of a person and recreates it.
Flora: But the illusion can‚Äôt be perfect! ‚Ä¶er, can it?
Natani: Well, no‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs only as good as the memories. That‚Äôs probably the reason why she looks younger. It‚Äôs how Keith remembers her best.Mike: But‚Ä¶ then that‚Äôs it, right? She looks young, s-so illusion, not ghost, yes?
Natani: You would think, but it‚Äôs not that simple‚Ä¶ The illusion claims to be a spirit using the spell as a means of‚Ä¶ manifesting itself.
Flora: So, okay‚Ä¶ If it really is an illusion, and it‚Äôs only made from memories that Keith has‚Ä¶
Flora: Well, then it is simple! We just as it something only Laura would know!
Kat: Yes, but‚Ä¶ Who else knows anything about Laura that Keith doesn‚Äôt? None of us really had enough time to‚Ä¶ get to know her.
Keith: No‚Ä¶ There is someone else.
Flora: (in Human) Keith?
Keith: Trace was there, before she‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶At the beach. He was holding her, and she was awake.
Laura: Keith, wait‚Ä¶
Keith: If he can prove to everyone what I know she is, then do it.
Flora: (in Human) Trace? Did you speak with Laura while you were carrying her?
Trace: (in Human) Huh? Uh, yeah, I did, why? What‚Äôs going on?Flora: Trace‚Ä¶
Trace: Huh? Oh, uh huh‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôll‚Ä¶? Ah‚Ä¶
Trace: I see.
Trace: Keith, are you sure about this?
Keith: Just get it over with.
Trace: Alright, then. Laura?
Laura: Eh?
Trace: I need to ask you something. When I was carrying you down from the mountain, you were pretty out of it. But you did tell me a few things. Do you recall what you said to me?
Laura: What I‚Ä¶ said‚Ä¶?
Laura: I‚Ä¶
Keith: Go on, Laura. Tell him.
Laura: (in Keidran) I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt remember‚Ä¶
Trace: Come again?
Laura: ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt remember. My memory is‚Ä¶ fuzzy.
Natani: (in Keidran) You see now? She doesn‚Äôt remember because Keith doesn‚Äôt know.
Keith: It doesn‚Äôt meant that! She was dying at the time! Of course she might not remember!
Trace: Laura, please. You mentioned the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Laura: Oh‚Ä¶ the first time we met? I‚Ä¶ know that‚Ä¶
Trace: You do?Laura: Well‚Ä¶ t-the first time we met was at the inn, wasn‚Äôt it? I fainted‚Ä¶ but Keith was there. I don‚Äôt know how that proves anything.
Trace: It does, because that isn‚Äôt right.
Keith: What?
Trace: We met once before. Something only the real Laura would know.
Flora: I‚Äôm sorry, Keith, I know this is hard‚Äî
Keith: No! No, she‚Äôs lying!
Keith: You‚Äôre lying to protect me, aren‚Äôt you?! Tell them!
Laura: I ‚Äî I can‚Äôt!
Keith: Laura, don‚Äôt do this to me! Tell the truth!
Group Member: Keith!
Laura: I don‚Äôt know it!
Keith: Tell them!!
Keith: Please‚Ä¶ just show them‚Ä¶ Please‚Ä¶ I need you to be real.Keith: Laura‚Ä¶ I need you. I have nothing left‚Ä¶
Laura: ‚Ä¶ But you do.
Laura: You have them.
Laura: Your friends. People who care about you.
Laura: People who love you.
Laura: Even if I were the real Laura, she wouldn‚Äôt want to see you wasting away for a few more days of life. She would want you to live on.
Keith: I don‚Äôt know if I can‚Ä¶
Laura: You have to, Keith. With them, I know you can.Keith: I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôve been so stupid.
Laura: No, Keith. You‚Äôre just in pain. You‚Äôve been in pain for so long. And I‚Äôm so sorry I added to it. But your friends can help you.
Laura: Please don‚Äôt stay bitter with the world. It‚Äôs not what I‚Ä¶ Laura would want.
Natani: Keith‚Ä¶
Keith: Yes, I get it. It‚Äôs time. I‚Äôm not ready, but‚Ä¶ I get it.
Keith: Laura‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have to pretend anymore. I understand now.Keith: Natani‚Ä¶ what do I do?
Natani: All you have to do is want it.
Keith: Want‚Ä¶ Laura gone? But‚Ä¶ how can I want that?
Laura: No, Keith. It‚Äôs about what you need more. And you know what that is. But you have to admit it to yourself!
Laura: Keith, say it.
Keith: I‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre right, Laura, you‚Äôre right.
Keith: I forgot for a while, but‚Ä¶ I need to live. You helped me to remember that.Laura: I‚Äôm so glad. I think you‚Äôve helped me too.
Laura: As long as I know I‚Äôm not holding you back, I can be content.
Keith: Laura‚Ä¶
Keith: La‚Äî uhh‚Ä¶
Natani: Woah! Hey, gotcha! The drain of the illusion is catching up with you.
Natani: Come on. I‚Äôm taking you back to your room.Evals: Man, am I glad all of that‚Äôs sorted now. Ghosts, that‚Äôs just what we needed. Hopefully, no more drama crops up.
Mike: Yeah‚Ä¶ ‚ÄîSNIFF‚Äî I hear ya.
Mike: Well, on a lighter note‚Ä¶ I meant to say earlier, but I see you decided to open up about the baby. Congrats!
Kat: Wait‚Ä¶ what?
Kat: You‚Äôre pregnant?!
Flora: You mean you‚Ä¶ really didn‚Äôt figure that out already? ‚Ä¶um, surprise?
Evals: Dang it, Mike!
Mike: Yip!Natani: Alright, here we are. Uh‚Ä¶ sorry about smacking your head on that door frame earlier.
Keith: Yeah, thanks. I‚Ä¶ think I can take it from here.
Natani: Hey, I wasn‚Äôt exaggerating when I said it was killing you. Just let me take care of it. You‚Äôll need help getting that fancy armor off, anyway.
Natani: There. You‚Äôre gunna feel like crap for a while, but you‚Äôll be okay.
Natani: Sleep. Tomorrow will be better.
Keith: Natani‚Ä¶ you do realize Basitins consider ear-rubbing to be‚Ä¶ an intimate gesture?
Natani: Oh‚Ä¶ Do‚Ä¶ do you want me to stop?
Keith: SIGH‚Ä¶
Keith: No.
Narration: End.TwoKinds 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY
ReflectionsTrace: You were right, Flora. Getting out of the cabin for a while was a good idea.
Flora: SIGH‚Ä¶
Flora: Yeah, this is nice. After everything that‚Äôs been going on lately, all I want to do right now is kick up my paws and relax.
Trace: Well, you‚Äôve been under a lot of stress lately. You deserve it.
Flora: You know, looking up at the stars like this, it almost reminds me of the first night we met. Do you remember that night in the forest?
Trace: How could I forget? It‚Äôs the very first day I have any memory of. From my perspective, that night was the first night I had ever experienced.Narration: That night, long ago‚Ä¶
Trace: Alright, that should be enough to last for now.
Trace: Oh, hey! You‚Äôre still up. I didn‚Äôt wake you, did I? I just left to gather more firewood.
Flora: No. I‚Äôve been awake.
Trace: Oh‚Ä¶ okay.
Trace: So, um‚Ä¶ since we‚Äôre both still up, there‚Äôs something I wanted to ask you earlier, but‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôd be rude to do so. That guy from before called you a ‚ÄúKeidran.‚Äù
Trace: Is that the name of your‚Ä¶ species?
Flora: ‚Ä¶Do you really not know? This isn‚Äôt some elaborate trick or something? Playing dumb to bring me back?
Trace: What? No, no!
Trace: I‚Äôm not trying to ‚Äúbring you back‚Äù anywhere. I was just curious. All I know for sure about Keidran so far is that they have orange fur and stripes.
Flora: What? We don‚Äôt all have‚Ä¶ wow, you don‚Äôt know much, do you?Trace: Okay, let me get this straight‚Ä¶ there are tiger Keidran, wolf Keidran, dog Keidran, and fox Keidran‚Ä¶
Flora: Right.
Trace: And then‚Ä¶ rabbit Keidran, and lizard Keidran, and fish Keid‚Äî
Flora: No, no, no! That‚Äôs wrong. I mean, yes, there are supposedly merfolk in the sea and I had heard stories from people about a species of reptiles in the mountains‚Ä¶ but none of those count as Keidran. Just canids and felids.
Trace: Well‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the difference? If both canids and felids count as Keidran, why not the others?
Flora: The difference is canid and felid Keidran are closely related. The other creatures are more primitive than our two species. They‚Äôre usually classified as beasts‚Ä¶ but then again, so are Keidran sometimes. Oh, and have I mentioned Basitins yet?
Trace: I‚Äôm so confused.
Flora: SIGH‚Ä¶
Flora: It‚Äôs alright, Trace. The only ones you‚Äôll need to know are us Keidran. All the rest are either far away or might not even exist.
Flora: And I can guarantee you‚Äôll never have to worry about meeting a Basitin. They live far off on some weird island or something.
Trace: Well, I‚Äôm sure glad I have you here to teach me about this stuff. I‚Äôd be totally lost right now without you.
Flora: Oh‚Ä¶ erm, you‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre welcome.Flora: Heehee! You were so clueless!
Trace: Hey! Gimme a break! It was my first day. I was experiencing everything all over again!
Flora: Well, you‚Äôre lucky I found your cluelessness so cute, then, human! Because that whole night while you were asleep I was up debating whether or not it would be safer for me to just‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶eat‚Äôcha.
Trace: R-really?
Flora: ‚Ä¶Nah!
Trace: Blarg!
Flora: Oh, but that reminds me! There‚Äôs something I wanted to show you!
Trace: Huh? What is it?Flora: Taadaa!
Trace: Hey! It‚Äôs the shirt I woke up in! I didn‚Äôt even know we still had it. Where did it come from?
Flora: I found it crumpled up at the bottom of your old backpack.
Flora: Urg‚Ä¶ certainly smells like it‚Äôs been stuck down there all this time, too. Say, how come you stopped wearing it?
Trace: What, you mean other than that big Templar emblem right on the front? Well, have you seen the back yet?
Flora: ‚Ä¶Oh.
Trace: The victim of one too many of your pounces, if I recall.
Flora: Right‚Ä¶ sorry. I really need to be more careful with my claws.Flora: Hang on, I hear footsteps. Someone‚Äôs coming up.
Trace: Hm?
Flora: Oh, it‚Äôs you! Evening, Keith!
Keith: Oh‚Ä¶ hey, you guys. Sorry, I didn‚Äôt know anyone else was up here at this time of night. I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶ interrupting anything, am I? I can come back later‚Ä¶
Flora: Nah! We were just going through some old stuff and reminiscing about the early days.
Flora: What are you up to?
Keith: Huh, that‚Äôs a coincidence. In a way, so was I.Keith: I‚Äôve been thinking about what you guys have been telling me.
Keith: About letting‚Ä¶ certain things go. So I brought up this.
Flora: Ooo! It‚Äôs the bucket helmet! What were you going to do with that?
Keith: If you must know, I was planning on dropping it into the ocean.
Flora: You‚Ä¶
Flora: ‚Ä¶what?!
Flora: Nrrraaaoh!!
Flora: You can‚Äôt just throw away Ol‚Äô Buckety!
Keith: Flora, do you even know why I wore that thing in the first place?Keith: I wore it out of obligation, not choice.
Keith: The armor was my father‚Äôs. It was a condition of my banishment ‚Äî to keep it with me, so that I would always remember what I‚Äôd done.
Keith: It worked. Every night, I would look into my helmet and see myself, alone. It was a constant reminder of what my father had done, and how I could never truly be rid of him.
Keith: I spent my life hating that man for what he‚Äôd done.
Keith: And now it turns out, my father was never the monster I thought he was. He may not have shown me any love, but he loved my mother.
Keith: And I killed him.
Keith: Either way, I don‚Äôt deserve to wear this helmet anymore!Natani: Keith, don‚Äôt.
Keith: ?!
Natani: I saw you going up. I figured you might be doing something foolish.
Keith: Natani? This doesn‚Äôt concern you.
Natani: I think it does.
Natani: I might not have been around as long as those two, but‚Ä¶ I know you. The moment you throw that helmet into the sea, you‚Äôll turn around and beat yourself up over it. You might even convince yourself that you somehow deserve it. But you don‚Äôt.
Natani: And neither does it, believe it or not. Because I know for a fact that you owe your life to that thing.
Natani: Lights out, ya‚Äô long-eared weirdo.
Natani: If it weren‚Äôt for that helmet, the day we first met would have turned out much differently. I would have aimed my arrow at your head. I, um‚Ä¶ regret that whole‚Ä¶ trying to murder you thing, by the way.
Keith: It‚Äôs okay, Natani. We‚Äôre even, since I did try the same thing at the inn. ‚Ä¶Granted, I stopped intentionally, whereas you failed due to incompetence.
Natani: ‚Ä¶Regretting it less now.Keith: But I get what you‚Äôre saying. I appreciate that you didn‚Äôt take my head off way back then.
Natani: Yeah, well, at the time I would have been more than happy to do so. It wasn‚Äôt exactly my intention to spare you.
Natani: But yeah, like I said, I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ certainly glad that didn‚Äôt happen. If I had known at the time that you were‚Ä¶ I mean‚Ä¶ I never imagined that one day I‚Äôd‚Ä¶ Um‚Ä¶ well, you see‚Ä¶ I really like having you around ‚Ä¶a-as a good friend, and‚Ä¶ stuff, so I‚Äî
Natani: Eep!
Keith: It‚Äôs okay, Natani.
Keith: I know. And‚Ä¶
Keith: Maybe you‚Äôre right about this thing.Flora: Yeah, Keith, he‚Äôs right! Besides, think of all the good times we‚Äôve had with Ol‚Äô Buckety!
Trace: Oh no‚Ä¶
Flora: Like that one time, when I stole all your clothes while you were bathing‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶and then sent them floating down the river as payback for attacking me that one time!
Keith: I knew I never should have trusted a bloody Keidran! I‚Äôll get you for this, Flora!
Keith: That wasn‚Äôt funny at all!
Keith: It took me nearly half an hour before I got them back! They went over a waterfall!Flora: Aw, come on now, Keith. Don‚Äôt be mad at me. I only tease you out of love.
Keith: Hmph!
Flora: Look, I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean to make you feel uncomfortable.
Keith: SIGH‚Ä¶
Keith: Fine. Since you apologized. And‚Ä¶ I suppose I can admit that it was, in hindsight‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶just a tiny bit funny.
Flora: That‚Äôs the spirit!
Flora: But honestly‚Ä¶ I know in the past you had a lot of bad memories associated with this helmet. But things have changed for you since then.
Flora: You‚Äôre no longer banished and your father wasn‚Äôt a monster. And I think when you look at it now‚Ä¶
Flora: You‚Äôll see things differently than you did before.Keith: (in Human) Alright, alright! I get what you‚Äôre both saying. I‚Äôll keep the dang helmet!
Flora: (in Human) Good!
Flora: (in Keidran) And now that that‚Äôs all settled, why don‚Äôt you two lie down and watch the stars with us?
Keith: (in Keidran) Well‚Ä¶ I suppose I don‚Äôt have anything better to do right now. What about you, Natani?
Natani: (in Keidran) Eh, if you‚Äôre going to, then sure, why not?
Narration: End.
Keith: ‚Ä¶You know what, Flora? You were right. This is nice.Narration: Epilogue
Keith: Hey, wait. Since we‚Äôre all sharing‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always wanted to ask you, Trace.
Trace: Hm? Me? Sure, what?
Keith: What‚Äôs the deal with that blue triangle you have on your face? Is it some kind of Templar tattoo? Birthmark? A magic seal, maybe?
Trace: What blue triangle?
Natani: ?Twokinds
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
STRANDEDRaine: Well‚Ä¶
Raine: I‚Äôve got good news and bad news.
Raine: The good news is the girls are stable. At least for now. Whatever the assassin used, it isn‚Äôt killing them.
Raine: It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ keeping them asleep. And that‚Äôs the bad news. Without knowing exactly what he used, there‚Äôs nothing I can do to help them.
Karen: WHIMPER‚Ä¶
Raine: I‚Äôve tried some simple remedies, but the sisters just won‚Äôt wake.
Raine: We need a cure, and the only one who might know it‚Ä¶ is the assassin.
Sythe: So in short, we‚Äôre totally boned.
Red: That isn‚Äôt helping!Red: What we need to do is think up a plan!
Sythe: A plan, from you? Now I know we‚Äôre doomed. Be careful not to strain yourself.
Red: Shut it, furball.
Red: Raine! Your mother was the former Grand Templar! You must have powerful magic! Right?
Raine: Well, yes‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I do have magic, but like I said, I was never trained. And it wouldn‚Äôt matter anyway.
Raine: As long as I‚Äôm trapped in this Keidran body, I‚Äôm stuck with all the biological issues that comes with being Keidran. I can‚Äôt cast magic without mana crystals!
Sythe: Well, what about this shackle thing? It turns you human, right? Then you can use magic without crystals.
Raine: This doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúturn me human.‚Äù This is a magic suppressor. It keeps my curse in check. But it also cuts off my magical abilities. If I managed to fix it, I then wouldn‚Äôt be able to use magic voluntarily. It‚Äôs lose-lose, either way.Red: Well, alright, maybe‚Ä¶ Maybe the two of us could just carry the girls?
Sythe: Okay, first, how? We can‚Äôt exactly defend ourselves while carrying two women. And Raine can‚Äôt carry them. Not for miles.
Sythe: Second, where? The nearest villages are either the one that was destroyed or the one who‚Äôs neighbour was just destroyed‚Ä¶ by wolves. Which, if you hadn‚Äôt noticed, two of us currently are!
Red: Oh, believe me, I‚Äôve noticed! I‚Äôve also noticed I‚Äôm the only one making any suggestions here! While all you do is complain!
Sythe: Yeah? Well so far my complaining seems to be about as effective! Maybe I wouldn‚Äôt need to poke holes in your plans if they weren‚Äôt all stupid!
Raine: Would you two cut it out!
Raine: We‚Äôre all tired and stressed, but this arguing isn‚Äôt helping any of us! So knock it off!
Sythe: Hmph. Fine. Whatever.
Sythe: I‚Äôll just stand guard in silence, then, since that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm good for. Maybe if I‚Äôm lucky, that assassin will have an extra sleep dart waiting for me.
Red: You do that, fleabag.
Red: Tch! Keidran! What did I do to deserve being stranded out here with these animals?Raine: (thoughts) ‚ÄúAnimal‚Ä¶‚Äù
Raine: (thoughts) Mother was right. Once people see me like this, it‚Äôs all they ever see.
Raine: (thoughts) But she also said if I tried hard enough, I could learn to control it like Euchre could! So why isn‚Äôt it working?!
Raine: Come on! Change back!
Raine: Change back already!
[SYTHE WAS HERE]
Sythe: You really are a moron, ya know that?
Red: I thought you said you were going to stay quiet.
Sythe: Maybe you ought to take your own advice! Raine‚Äôs already uncomfortable enough being Keidran without you using Keidran slurs around her!
Red: Wha-? She knows I wasn‚Äôt referring to her! I only meant you and the bastard hunting us!
Sythe: Somehow, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how she interpreted it. But fine, keep doing what you‚Äôre doing.
Sythe: Maybe it‚Äôll help convince her she‚Äôd be better off with‚Ä¶ someone of her own kind.
Red: H-hey! She‚Äôs not one of your kind, no matter how she looks! Don‚Äôt get any ideas!
Sythe: Perhaps you should be telling her that, then.Raine: Ugh‚Ä¶ why is fur so itchy? Is this normal? I hope the guys don‚Äôt think I have‚Äî
Red: Hey, Raine.
Red: Just checking to make sure you‚Äôre‚Äî
Raine: I don‚Äôt have fleas!
Red: ‚Ä¶Huh?
Raine: Er, I mean‚Ä¶ h-hey! I, uh‚Ä¶ thought you needed to be out there to watch Sythe‚Äôs back?
Red: Eh, he‚Äôs right outside, and I can see him from here. He‚Äôs still being pissy.
Sythe: I can hear you‚Ä¶
Red: So what are you working on?
Raine: SIGH‚Ä¶
Raine: Well, since I‚Äôm no help to the girls, I figured I might as well try and see if I can fix this thing. It‚Äôs just a crack, so hopefully it won‚Äôt be impossible.
Red: Oh, I thought you said it wouldn‚Äôt help?
Raine: Maybe not with this situation, but‚Ä¶ Well, right now it‚Äôs my only hope of being human again.
Red: Oh, gotcha. I can see why you wouldn‚Äôt want to look like that any longer than necessary!
Raine: ‚Ä¶
Red: Er, I mean‚Äî! Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with‚Ä¶ how‚Ä¶ Wow, this stuff really does just fall out of my mouth, doesn‚Äôt it?Raine: Hey, look, it‚Äôs cool, alright? I‚Äôm used to it. My mother was the same way. She could barely look at me.
Raine: You don‚Äôt have to keep pretending we‚Äôre still friends. I know I‚Äôm not the girl you thought I was.
Red: No! That‚Äôs not how it is! I‚Äôm not pretending! I‚Äôm not clever enough to pretend!
Red: Ugh, I‚Äôm just an idiot, and I‚Äôm sorry.
Red: I admit the way you look now is still something I haven‚Äôt gotten used to. But‚Ä¶
Red: We are still friends, alright? I promise.Raine: Thanks. I know how you normally feel about‚Ä¶ non-humans, so that means a lot.
Raine: (thoughts) Even if I‚Äôm not sure I believe it‚Ä¶
Red: Are you sure you‚Äôre alright? You still don‚Äôt seem like it.
Raine: Huh? N-no, I‚Äôm fine, why?
Red: Well, I‚Äôm no expert on Keidran facial expressions, but‚Ä¶ Your ears‚Ä¶
Raine: Oh.
Raine: Right, these stupid things. Don‚Äôt mind them. They don‚Äôt listen to me.
Red: ‚Ä¶They only listen for you, right? Snrk! Get it? Because they‚Äôre ears.
Red: Aw, now they‚Äôre back down again!
Red: That‚Äôs kinda cute.
Red: Ack!
Raine: Sorry, sometimes my tail has a mind of its own too.Red: Hey, cut it out! Hah! Gotcha!
Raine: AH!
Raine: H-hey!
Red: Now that I think about it, having a tail must be even weirder than moving ears!
Raine: C-could you please not‚Ä¶
Red: We already have ears, but tails are a completely new limb altogether!
Raine: N-no really, you shouldn‚Äôt‚Äî
Raine: Eep!
Red: Can you really control how it moves? I can‚Äôt even imagine how that would feel.
Red: You know, despite my misgivings about other races, I admit I‚Äôve always wondered just how you can‚Äî
Raine: Stop!Raine: Are you sure you‚Äôre alright?
Red: Just a bit winded, eheh. Sorry for the tail thing.
[SYTHE WAS HERE]
Sythe: (thoughts) How can those two fool around at a time like this?
Sythe: (thoughts) We‚Äôre stuck out here in this hopeless situation and they‚Äôre still acting like we‚Äôre on a picnic in the woods. Meanwhile, there‚Äôs an assassin lying in wait, just looking for an opportunity to strike.
Sythe: Where are you?! Why don‚Äôt you just get it over with, coward!
Sythe: Hoping I drop my guard, no doubt. Well it ain‚Äôt happening! I am the embodiment of vigilance‚Ä¶ constantly on alert. He could be anywhere‚Ä¶
Sythe: He could be lurking in the trees‚Ä¶ He could be hiding in the bushes‚Ä¶
Sythe: He could even be‚Ä¶
Sythe: Right behind me!Sythe: Ugh‚Ä¶ keep it together, Sythe. You‚Äôre really losing it.
Sythe: Unless‚Ä¶
Sythe: You‚Äôre not another one of his illusion tricks, are you?
Sythe: Well, you could still be one of his minions. I‚Äôm watching you.
Sythe: Feh! What does it even matter? This is my life now apparently. What am I doing out here? Standing around in the rain waiting to be attacked while defending people who hate my guts.
Nibbly: ‚Ä¶..
Sythe: Well, okay, maybe not all of them. Raine‚Äôs alright. We‚Äôre certainly not ‚Äúfriends‚Äù though. So why am I risking my life for humans who don‚Äôt even appreciate me?
Raine: Um, i-is he talking to that‚Ä¶ squirrel?
Red: Yep. Wolf boy‚Äôs finally snapped.
Red: Hey Nutcase, what‚Äôs going on?
Sythe: I don‚Äôt think I can take any more of this.Raine: (thoughts) I hope can talk some sense into Sythe‚Ä¶ and not start another fight. Hmph‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs strange.
Raine: (thoughts) I was so sure once the truth was out, my friends would end up turning on me. And yet‚Ä¶ one of the most anti-keidran people I‚Äôve ever met now knows‚Ä¶ and he‚Äôs still attempting to be nice to me!
Raine: (thoughts) Sure he doesn‚Äôt look at me in the same way as before, but he is trying, I can tell. And if he of all people can act civil‚Ä¶
Raine: (thoughts) Maybe‚Ä¶ maybe mother was wrong. Maybe there is hope for humans and keidran to coexist!
Sythe: THAT‚ÄôS IT! I‚ÄôVE HAD IT!
Red: Hey! Where do you think you‚Äôre going? We had an agreement!
Sythe: We agreed to a truce! But so far you‚Äôve still done nothing but treat me like dirt! Well I‚Äôm done! I‚Äôm out of here!
Red: You‚Äôre leaving now? What are you, a moron? You can‚Äôt!Red: Are you seriously telling me you‚Äôd abandon the girls to try and save your own hide?! To think I almost considered that Keidran might not all be bad, but I was right all along! You‚Äôre all the same! Backstabbing cowards!
Sythe: I‚Äôd rather be thought a coward and live to tell about it than die out here in this hopeless situation for a racist asshole like you!
Red: What did you call me!?
Raine: Stop! Something‚Äôs not right! Sythe, what‚Äôs gotten into you? You can‚Äôt go! What about Maren and Karen? They need you! And leaving will just make everyone an easier target! You know that!
Sythe: ‚Ä¶Yes. I know. Leaving will make an easier target‚Ä¶ out of both of us. And I‚Äôm sorry, Raine. But if I had to choose between your lives and mine‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶
Raine: Sythe!Sythe: Hey! I don‚Äôt need you sitting there silently judging me! I know this is crazy! But you saw what it was like back there. This was the only choice!
Sythe: Still‚Ä¶ Maren‚Ä¶ Karen‚Ä¶ Sure, they were both irritating, but they don‚Äôt deserve to be left defenseless.
Sythe: And without me‚Ä¶ if the assassin decides to come back‚Ä¶
Sythe: No! I can‚Äôt let myself think like that! I made up my mind and there‚Äôs no going back! I just have to keep running and‚Äî
Nibbly: Eek!
Sythe: Eek!Sythe: Oooph!
Zen: Well, well, well‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve certainly caused me a lot of trouble these last few days. But I‚Äôve got you now.
Sythe: W-wait! Please! Don‚Äôt kill me!
Zen: Relax, Sythe! It‚Äôs your lucky day! Your uncle wants you back alive, and I happen to need the bonus. Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs any better, though. I‚Äôm pretty sure the penalty for treason is still death‚Ä¶
Sythe: No! T-there‚Äôs been a mistake! You‚Äôve got the wrong wolf! I‚Äôm not this ‚ÄúSythe‚Äù guy you‚Äôre talking about!
Zen: Oh, quit being so dramatic.
Sythe: No, really! I‚Äôm not! Y-you see‚Ä¶ the truth is, in actuality, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm‚Ä¶
Sythe: ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm the bait.Narration: A few minutes later‚Ä¶
Sythe: Ah, that‚Äôs better. Thanks, Raine. And you too, little one.
Raine: Is he going to be okay?
Red: He‚Äôd better be if we‚Äôre going to get the antidote out of him.
Raine: I can‚Äôt believe you two planned that whole fight back there!
Sythe: Yeah, well I can‚Äôt believe it actually worked. I was sure Red‚Äôs acting would give us away.
Red: Pretending to be angry at a Keidran wasn‚Äôt exactly a challenge. Besides, back when I was a trainee, I was in the Templar theatre troupe!
Sythe: Yeah, well‚Ä¶ wait, what?!
Red: What?
Sythe: The Templar had a theatre troupe? And you were in it?!
Red: Yeah‚Ä¶ why?
Sythe: Well, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt seem like the type, is all.
Red: Hey. I love the theatre. You‚Äôd better not be dissing it.
Sythe: No, no, I was just‚Ä¶ you know what, nevermind.Narration: Meanwhile, halfway across the ocean‚Äî
Natani: SNRRRKK!
Keith: Urrgh‚Ä¶ my‚Ä¶ everything. Where am I? What‚Äôs that awful noise?
Keith: Geh! And who‚Äôs breathing on me?!
Natani: SNXRRRAAAKK!
Keith: Oh.
Keith: (thoughts) Right, this is my room. Natani carried me here. ‚Ä¶Guess I wasn‚Äôt the only one to fall asleep.
Keith: (thoughts) I-I‚Äôm sure it was just by accident.
Keith: (thoughts) Still, I should probably get up before Natani wa‚Äî Erk!
Keith: Alright! I‚Äôll stay a little longer!
Keith: J-just‚Ä¶ let me breathe!Natani: SNRRRKK!
Keith: Alright, maybe if I turn my body to the side and pull away slowly‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶I might be able to escape from Natani‚Äôs freakish wolf strength.
Keith: It‚Äôs a good thing Natani‚Äôs such a heavy sleeper. I should be able to just slip out‚Äî
Flora: I hope Kathrin isn‚Äôt mad at me‚Ä¶ she seemed upset when I told everyone about my condition‚Äî
Keith: KYAAAAAAH!!
Flora: Huh? Keith?
Keith: N-Natani, stop! Cut it out!
Flora: What‚Äôs going on? Is Natani hurting him?!
Keith: D-don‚Äôt put your mouth there! Ah! No! Watch the teeth! I told you I‚Äôm sensitive there! Natani!
Flora: (thoughts) Don‚Äôt think about it, don‚Äôt think about it‚Ä¶
Keith: Ow! Quit gnawing on it! It‚Äôs not a dog bone, damn it!
Flora: (thoughts) Don‚Äôt think about it!Keith: Erg! Just‚Ä¶ need to‚Ä¶ get‚Ä¶
Keith: Free‚Äî waaah!
Natani: Mmmrph?
Natani: ‚Ä¶.
Natani: ‚Ä¶Hi Keith.
Keith: Hullo, Natani.
Natani: I‚Äôm in your bed, aren‚Äôt I?
Keith: Yes, Natani. Yes you are.
Natani: Right. Sorry. Don‚Äôt supposed we can pretend this never happened?
Keith: Like usual? Eh, it‚Äôs alright, no harm done. Save for my poor ear‚Ä¶
Keith: And anyway, I appreciate you being here. I‚Ä¶ I was in a real bad way after‚Ä¶ well, you know. So, thanks. I needed this.
Natani: Oh‚Ä¶ sure, no problem. I‚Äôm glad I could help.
Keith: Now, I think what I could really use is a long bath.
Keith: Uuh‚Ä¶
Keith: Ngh!
Natani: Huh? Keith!Natani: Hey, take it easy!
Keith: Urgh‚Ä¶ I feel weak.
Natani: Of course you do! I wasn‚Äôt kidding when I said that spell was killing you.
Keith: I felt fine earlier.
Natani: Your body was likely still numb to the damage. Now that you‚Äôve had a chance to rest, it‚Äôs catching up with you. I doubt it‚Äôs permanent, but you‚Äôre probably going to feel like crap for a couple days.
Keith: ‚Ä¶Great‚Ä¶
Natani: Hey! You cut that out right now!
Keith: Huh?
Natani: Stop kicking yourself like you always do. You‚Äôll be fine, alright? And in the meantime, you‚Äôve got me to lean on. So cheer up, that‚Äôs an order!
Keith: You know, now that I‚Äôm a general I don‚Äôt take orders from anyone but my king.
Natani: Well then, General Keiser, you‚Äôd better start calling me king, because I‚Äôm taking care of you whether you like it or not.
Keith: ‚Ä¶Heh. I guess you‚Äôre tall enough.
Keith: Sigh‚Ä¶ Alright, then, Your Highness. I‚Äôll try.
Natani: Good. Now come on, soldier. Let‚Äôs go.Flora: (thoughts) Ack! There they are. Don‚Äôt look, don‚Äôt look!
Flora: (thoughts) Oh, my‚Ä¶ Keith and Natani‚Ä¶ I mean, I should have figured. after the whole bath incident. But still. They both just seemed so‚Ä¶ prudish!
Flora: (thoughts) And so soon after Laura‚Ä¶ well, everyone grieves differently, I suppose. I wonder what Trace will think of this?
Flora: (thoughts) No, no, no! Bad Flora! Don‚Äôt gossip about your friends!
Flora: (thoughts) Keith and Natani are both shy. If they haven‚Äôt said yet, then they probably don‚Äôt want people to know.
Flora: (thoughts) I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want people gossiping about me, especially now that they know‚Ä¶
Evals: Hey! Watch it Sister! Comin‚Äô through!
Flora: Oh, sorry!

Flora: Hey wait, what are you two up to?
Evals: Uh‚Ä¶
Evals: Nothin‚Äô.Flora: Right‚Ä¶ A whole crate of ‚Äúnothin‚Äô‚Äù huh?
[BASITIN RUM]
Evals: What? Oh, these things?
Evals: Naw, they‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ ya know, some stuff Eric wants moved. Really, it is! You could ask him, but‚Ä¶ might as well take our word for it! And if you don‚Äôt buy that, it was all Mike‚Äôs idea.
Flora: Hey, relax. I‚Äôm not going to go and tattle on you. But don‚Äôt expect me and Trace to come bail you two out a second time doing something stupid.
Evals: Aw, thanks, Stripes! I knew you weren‚Äôt the killjoy Mike said you were! See, the way I see it, we helped Eric earn this stuff. So now we‚Äôre simply collecting our dues!
Evals: Say! I never did thank you properly for getting us out from under Eric‚Äôs thumb. Here! A gift! Congrats on the new kid! Just be careful. I think it explodes if you drop it too hard.
Mike: Evals! You can‚Äôt give an expecting mother hard liquor!
Evals: Well, what else am I going to give her? I don‚Äôt own anything else!
[MAGICAL ARTIFACTS  PROPERTY OF ERIC VAUGHAN]
[BASITIN RUM]Flora: It‚Ä¶ it explodes?
Evals: Just a little. It‚Äôs mostly harmless. If you can‚Äôt drink, give it to your boyfriend.
Evals: By the way‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how you convinced him that kid was his, but don‚Äôt worry! Me and Mike won‚Äôt spill the beans on ya! Us ex-slaves gotta stick together!
Flora: W-what?!
Flora: What are you implying?! It is his! I‚Äôve never even been with anyone else!
Evals: Hey, relax! I get it! Those uptight humans are completely obsessed with their ‚Äúmonogamy‚Äù. They can‚Äôt understand that we Keidran have different needs. But don‚Äôt worry, your secret‚Äôs safe with me!
Flora: It‚Äôs the truth, you jerk! You know what, maybe I will go to Eric after all!
Evals: Nah, ya won‚Äôt! You‚Äôre too nice! Later, Stripes!
Flora: Meerrr‚Ä¶ You‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ Canines!
Flora: Sigh‚Ä¶ Is this really what everyone thinks of me? That I‚Äôm just lying to Trace? What if he‚Ä¶
Flora: I know he said he believed me‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs always trusted me, ever since we first met. But if enough people start questioning it‚Ä¶ will he stay by my side? What if‚Ä¶
Flora: (thoughts) What if he really doesn‚Äôt believe me and is just pretending he does? What if it‚Äôs been tearing him up this whole time? He could even be freaking out right now! I have to do something!

Natani: Welp‚Ä¶ here we are.
Keith: R-right‚Ä¶ there it is.
Keith: So‚Ä¶
Natani: ‚Ä¶Yeah‚Ä¶
Natani: Alright, look. We both knew this was coming. Let‚Äôs not pretend otherwise. Now, I know you‚Äôll want to say you can handle it‚Ä¶
Natani: But this is going to take at least some effort‚Ä¶ and you had to take a break just walking down the steps to get here. I just don‚Äôt want you passing out and drowning on me after all this.
[WASH ROOM]
Natani: So I think we should just act like adults here and get it over with.
Keith: Right‚Ä¶ yeah, I guess we have no choice but to go in together‚Ä¶ for safety reasons.
Natani: Right! Safety.
Natani: (thoughts) Not as though this is the first time, after all‚Ä¶ Just the first time it hasn‚Äôt been an accident. So why does that make this feel more awkward?Keith: Blegh!
Keith: A little cold, don‚Äôt you think?!
Natani: Sorry! I think whatever the tower did also had an effect on the ship‚Äôs enchantments.
Natani: Don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs slow, but once this rinse is done, the bath should have warmed up.
Keith: ‚Ä¶Thanks.
Keith: Natani‚Ä¶ why are you doing all this for me?
Natani: W-what do you mean?
Keith: You know what I mean. You‚Äôve been acting a little different towards me since we woke up. More‚Ä¶ open. It‚Äôs nice, but‚Ä¶ weird, coming from you.
Natani: (thoughts) Have I? Yeah, I‚Ä¶ guess maybe I have.
Natani: Laura‚Ä¶ the way she looked right at me ‚Äî like she was pleading for me to take care of him. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ maybe I was just imagining it, but‚Ä¶ Real or not‚Ä¶
Natani: Look, what does it matter? I‚Äôm just glad you‚Äôre not dead, that‚Äôs all! So I‚Äôm being nicer. Just don‚Äôt get used to it! Once you get your strength back, I won‚Äôt go easy on‚Äî
Keith: No. No more evading.
Natani: Huh?
Keith: Natani, I need to know‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs going on between us?Natani: Keith‚Ä¶ do we really have to do this now? Can‚Äôt we just enjoy the rest of the ship ride without so much‚Ä¶ emotional stuff? I mean, after everything that happened earlier‚Äî
Keith: That‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm asking! I know, I just lost Laura, but‚Ä¶
Keith: Well, the truth is, I‚Äôve been mourning her loss for a long time now. It made me a bitter person for years. But now‚Ä¶ Because of your spell, I feel like I finally have some closure. Like I can move on now.
Natani: Alright, I get that, but‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt know what to say.
Natani: You want a straight answer? Then fine. Yes, there is a‚Ä¶ small part of me that‚Ä¶ has feelings for you. But I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs really me‚Ä¶ or the female body making me feel that way.
Natani: Tell me this, Keith: if we had never ended up in the same bath that night we first met, and I was still a guy to you, would you even be asking me this right now?
Keith: Um‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt say for sure, but considering you kissed me back at the tavern, I think I might question it even more.
Natani: We agreed not to look into that!Keith: I‚Äôm just saying, it‚Äôs a little weird for a guy to kiss a friend out of the blue like that.
Natani: I was under a lot of stress, okay?! The tavern was on fire, you had just saved my life from‚Ä¶ well, admittedly you, and after all that‚Ä¶ it was the heat of the moment!
Keith: Well if you think about it, we were in a similar situation now. I was under a lot of stress, the ship was on fire apparently, and you ended up saving my life earlier from something that came from you.
Keith: But I know you wouldn‚Äôt like me suddenly kissing you for no reason and saying it was the ‚Äúheat of the moment‚Äù!
Natani: Well maybe I would!Natani: Keith, wait, I-!
Keith: No, no, it‚Äôs okay! I know what you‚Äôre going to say. I wasn‚Äôt serious either! You know me, I‚Äôd never just up and‚Ä¶ do that to you. You know, not unless you asked me to‚Ä¶ which I know you never would, so it‚Äôs a moot point. Heheh‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶Natani?
Keith: Are‚Ä¶ are you okay?
Keith: This is the part where you‚Äôre supposed to deny it too.
Natani: Sigh‚Ä¶
Natani: In that case‚Ä¶
Natani: Then I‚Äôm asking you.
Keith: Asking me to what?Keith: N-Natani, are you sure? This seems so fast, maybe we should wait until‚Äî
Natani: It‚Äôs up to you, Keith, but it‚Äôs now or never. I know myself, and in another minute, I‚Äôll try to laugh it off as a joke.
Keith: Okay, then. If you‚Äôre sure‚Ä¶
Keith: Then I will. Ready?
Natani: Y-yes?
Natani: !
Natani: (thoughts) No!
Natani: Was‚Ä¶ was that really it?
Keith: Uh‚Ä¶ I guess?Keith: Was it that bad?
Natani: No! Not bad, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ after all of that build up, I was expecting it to be more‚Ä¶ I dunno‚Ä¶ eventful? Momentous? Just‚Ä¶ anything to help me sort out my feelings once and for all, but it was just‚Ä¶ Brief.
Keith: Sigh, I know‚Ä¶ I tried, but I was probably almost as reluctant as you. Not that I didn‚Äôt want to, but‚Ä¶ I think deep down‚Ä¶ even knowing your secret, I really have seen you as one of the guys! So this change was a bit strange for me too.
Natani: (thoughts) ‚ÄúOne of the guys‚Äù?
Keith: I guess I can see now how you must feel, at least a little, kissing someone you view as a guy. It must have been really hard for you. Sorry it ended up being disappointing.
Natani: Keith‚Ä¶
Keith: Huh‚Äî Mmph!
Natani: (thoughts) Well, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to try again!
Keith: Mmph‚Ä¶Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
[SYTHE WAS HERE]
Sythe: Sooooo‚Ä¶ How long do you think he‚Äôs going to be out?
Raine: You hit him pretty hard. The rock may have given him a concussion.
Red: Well I had to be sure he‚Äôd stay down.
Sythe: Yeah, better safe than sorry. Still, we need him to tell us what kind of poison he used on the girls, so he can‚Äôt die on us yet.
Raine: You know, I expected an assassin to be a lot scarier in person, but he‚Äôs actually kind of cute, for a wolf boy.
Red: Raine! Don‚Äôt go complimenting the guy trying to kill us!
Raine: I know. I‚Äôm not being serious.
Raine: It‚Äôs just nice to finally feel safe again! We make a pretty good team. Especially now that you two have put aside your differences. We‚Äôre all friends now!
Red: Well, we‚Äôre friends with you, but I don‚Äôt think Sythe and I will‚Äî

Sythe: Well‚Ä¶ it was. Sigh‚Ä¶ Back to being the only keidran in the group again. It was fun while it lasted.
Raine: Now for the rest!
Red: Uh‚Ä¶ Raine?
Raine: Aw, come on! What‚Äôs wrong now?! I can‚Äôt be stuck like this! It‚Äôs worse than before!
Red: Hey, look on the bright side, at least you don‚Äôt have the face of a‚Äî nmph!
Raine: What?
Red: Nothin‚Äô!
Red: (thoughts) Caught it that time.Raine: Sigh‚Ä¶
Red: It‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really not that bad, you know? If you ignore the legs, it kinda looks like you‚Äôre wearing a Keidran costume.
Raine: Heh. Yeah. I‚Äôm sorry for spoiling the mood. I‚Äôm still glad we‚Äôre safer now. It‚Äôs just a little frustrating, is all. But you guys don‚Äôt have to worry about me, I‚Äôll be okay.
Sythe: YAWN!
Nibbly: ?
Red: If you‚Äôre sure.
Sythe: Well, I don‚Äôt know how long that guy‚Äôs going to be out. But this is the first chance we‚Äôve had to get some sleep. I think now‚Äôs as good a time as any. Red, why don‚Äôt you and Raine get some rest. We‚Äôll take first watch.
Red: ‚ÄúWe?‚Äù
Red: I don‚Äôt think so. How about I watch him while you get some sleep.
Sythe: What?! Seriously, after all that happened, you still don‚Äôt trust me? Because I‚Äôm a wolf?
Red: No, I don‚Äôt trust you because you just referred to that rodent like it‚Äôs a person.
Sythe: Hey! You leave Mrs. Nibbly out of this!
Raine: Hey, boys! Hello? I‚Äôm still here, and I‚Äôve actually slept recently. Why don‚Äôt I watch him?Red: Raine, I don‚Äôt think you watching him alone is such a good idea. I mean, no offense, but you‚Äôre already hurt, and if he broke out‚Ä¶
Raine: I know. You‚Äôre right I certainly wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance in a fight. But if one of you guys falls asleep on watch, there won‚Äôt be any fight at all.
Sythe: She‚Äôs got a point.
Red: Hmph, yeah, I guess.
Red: Alright. I don‚Äôt like it, but I agree, this is the best choice. Here.
Raine: Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll call out if he wakes up.
Red: Good. Once he does, we can trade his life for the name of the poison, and then be long gone from here.
Raine: Right! Don‚Äôt worry, us girls will hold the fort. Isn‚Äôt that right, Mrs Nibbly?
Red: Oh no, not you too! There‚Äôs something off about that thing.
Sythe: Hey‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre not really letting this guy go after this, are we?
Red: Of course not! But Raine doesn‚Äôt need to hear that.
Red: Even without any weapons or crystals, he‚Äôs still dangerous.
Red: Once we have what we need, I‚Äôll take him away from here and‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúLet him go.‚ÄùRaine: (thoughts) I shouldn‚Äôt feel bad. I know they‚Äôre just trying to shield me.
Raine: (thoughts) It‚Äôs just a little hard not to feel hurt. I might be a little naive sometimes, but I understand the situation we‚Äôre stuck with.
Raine: (thoughts) It would be a bad idea to give this guy another opportunity to try and trick us again in the future.
Raine: (thoughts) And I‚Äôm all too aware of how dangerous someone with magic can be.
Raine: (thoughts) Still, I wish there was another way. Even someone like this guy must have friends or family out there waiting for him to come back home. I wonder where they might be.
Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Keith: Wow. Now that was‚Ä¶ something.
Natani: Yes‚Ä¶ quite.
Natani: (thoughts) I am never going to hear the end of this from Zen whenever he decides to finally wake up today. Thank goodness his mind still seems to be asleep at the moment.Keith: So‚Ä¶ where do we go from here?
Natani: ‚ÄúFrom here?‚Äù
Natani: W-well, I was thinking we should probably go down to our usual sparring spot! Get to work building your strength up before we hit the mainland again.
Keith: Natani, you know what I mean! Are we‚Ä¶ are the two of us in a relationshi‚Äî
Natani: Don‚Äôt say it!
Keith: Mmph?
Natani: We‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ really good friends, okay?!
Keith: Mmmgh‚Ä¶
Natani: Do we need to put a label on it? Can‚Äôt we just‚Ä¶ see where things go without thinking about it too much right now?
Keith: So, just let it happen as it happens? ‚Ä¶Alright, I can do that.
Natani: Good‚Ä¶ good. That‚Äôs much easier on my psyche.Narration: Later that night‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace and I should sit out in the stars more often. Even with the cold, it does help to destress.
Flora: I wonder if Kat would be willing to fix this? I mean‚Ä¶ I know it‚Äôs a Templar shirt, but, I still associate it with Trace.
Flora: Maybe Kat could change the embl‚Äî
Eric: Get back here!
Flora: Huh?
Flora: Maddie?
Eric: Hah! I‚Äôve got you now! I knew this thing would come in handy! You might be sneaky, but you can‚Äôt hide from magic!
Flora: Eric!Eric: Ow! What was that for?
Flora: You know full well, Eric! I knew you were a perv, but this? What do you think you‚Äôre doing chasing around a little girl?
Eric: Huh? What are you talking about?
Flora: Don‚Äôt give me that! I know all about your little ‚Äúgrabby hands‚Äù!
Eric: What?! Flora, I assure you I have absolutely no interest in that little pest in the way you seem to be implying. What gave you that idea?
Flora: Then why are you chasing after her?
Eric: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Because she‚Äôs a stowaway!
Flora: And what were you planning to do once you caught her?
Eric: Well, I was planning on throwing the brat overboard.
Eric: Hey! Easy! I meant in a life boat, of course!Flora: We are not going to throw an innocent girl into the sea!
Eric: Not too innocent if you ask me. And it‚Äôs not as if it‚Äôs a foreign concept to the Basitin. Just ask Keith.
Flora: What the Basitin did to Keith was just as cruel!
Eric: It‚Äôs not like I enjoy tossing kids into the ocean or anything, but we can‚Äôt just keep her here! She‚Äôs not a stray cat!
Madelyn: Meow!
Eric: Look, we‚Äôre still well within Basitin waters, and the Basitin have the largest fleet in this area. All I‚Äôm suggesting is giving her a boat, some supplies, and leaving her here before we drag her any farther! Otherwise, all we‚Äôre doing is kidnapping her!
Madelyn: You won‚Äôt be kidnapping me, silly!
Madelyn: I probably should have brought this up earlier, but you see, I have‚Ä¶
Madelyn: A permission slip!Eric: Why didn‚Äôt you show us this before?!
Madelyn: Well, you seemed awfully busy at the time. So I thought I‚Äôd just explore the ship a little‚Ä¶ you know, look around, check out the crew‚Ä¶
Madelyn: ‚Ä¶Find some parchment‚Ä¶ (Honestly, what ship doesn‚Äôt have parchment in its storage hold?)
Eric: What was that?
Madelyn: Nothing! Here ya go!
Eric: Huh? What the-?
[ONE FREE ADMITION]
[I‚ÄôM SORRY. PLEASE DON‚ÄôT THROW ME OVERBOARD.]
[MY NEW FRENDS!]
Madelyn: Alright, I don‚Äôt really have anything official. I snuck on board to support General Keith, but this is my first time away from my island, and I was a little scared. And when I get scared my first instinct is to cause a distraction and run away. That‚Äôs usually my job in the military. It‚Äôs why my nickname is madness.
Keith: Madness, huh?Keith: I remember you from earlier.
Madelyn: K-Keith, I‚Äôm-!
Madelyn: Gasp!
Madelyn: T-tails‚Ä¶ touching‚Ä¶
Madelyn: But‚Ä¶ both‚Ä¶ boys‚Ä¶
Madelyn: Oooooooh‚Ä¶
Madelyn: Sir! We met briefly in person on the docks, and earlier at your trial.
Madelyn: Lt. Madelyn Adelaide, East Basitin Recon Division, Infiltration class! Reporting for duty!
Keith: Infiltration class? So is that what you‚Äôre doing here? Infiltrating?
Madelyn: Er‚Ä¶ n-no‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ I guess technically, yes, Sir.Keith: Sigh‚Ä¶ Alright, so you snuck aboard the ship to follow me. Please tell me someone on the island knows you‚Äôre here.
Madelyn: Oh, of course! I wouldn‚Äôt leave without informing my superior officer!
Madelyn: (Or at least‚Ä¶ if she doesn‚Äôt know yet, she soon will‚Ä¶)
Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
King Adelaide: Maddie, dear! Are you alright? The guards tell me you haven‚Äôt been seen outside your room in‚Äî huh?
[TO MOMMY ‚ô•]
King Adelaide: What‚Äôs this?
King Adelaide: MAAADELYYYYYYN!!!
Evals: Did you hear something?Keith: Well, if those on the island know she‚Äôs here‚Ä¶ Eric, could you please let her stay on board?
Eric: I doubt I have much choice in the matter. As long as you‚Äôre responsible for her. We‚Äôll have to find room for her.
Flora: Say‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a good point. We‚Äôve been at sea for days. Where have you been sleeping all this time? In the store room?
Madelyn: Oh, I slept all over!
[COFFEE]
Flora: Hee-hee! Oh, Trace~!
Eric: Hm‚Ä¶ I think I know just the place to put you. The only place in the ship with a spare bed.
Madelyn: Oh? Where?!Flora: Eric‚Ä¶
Eric: Relax, Flora. I left the door unlocked this time.
Madelyn: Eric, you made a mistake! You didn‚Äôt leave it unlocked. You actually added a second‚Äî
Eric: Anyway! Glad that‚Äôs finally over with.
Eric: I hope that‚Äôs the last I have to hear about Basitin stowaways turning up out of nowhere and‚Ä¶
Lynn: Hello. I am Messenger Lynn. I am Keith‚Äôs other servant. Would you care for some refreshments? I‚Äôve taken the liberty of preparing some fresh tea, and there‚Äôs a coffee cake baking in the kitchen.
Eric: Okay. You, I like. I‚Äôll have Mike and Evals set up the spare guest room.
Flora: Wait‚Ä¶ who is that guy?! What‚Äôs going on?
Madelyn: ‚ÄúSpare guest room‚Äù?!Sythe: SNRRAAACK!
Sythe: Pheeew‚Ä¶
Sythe: SNRRAACK!
Sythe: Pheeew‚Ä¶
Sythe: SNRRAACK!
Nibbly: ?
Sythe: Pheeew‚Äî
Nibbly: EEK!
Sythe: üíß
Sythe: Bleck!
Sythe: Nibs! Are you crazy?! Be more careful! If I were any other predator, well‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no reason to tempt fate.
Raine: Augh, no!
Sythe: Huh? Raine?!Sythe: Raine!
Sythe: What‚Äôs wrong? Did he escape? Are we under attack?!
Nibbly: !
Sythe: Oh‚Ä¶
Sythe: Everything okay, Raine?
Raine: I have a muzzle again.
Sythe: Ah‚Ä¶ yeah. So you do.
Raine: Mmmgh‚Ä¶ I was getting frustrated trying to fix this stupid magic inhibitor, and‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶
Raine: Losing control of my emotions seems to make me lose control of my form.
Raine: Still, I appreciate you keeping an ear out for me. Sorry to wake you for nothing but my problems.
Sythe: Don‚Äôt worry about it, Raine. I‚Äôd already been woken up.[SYTHE WAS HERE]
Sythe: I‚Äôm glad to see your ‚Äúfriend‚Äù is still here.
Raine: Yes. He hasn‚Äôt moved since last night. Lots of drool, though.
Sythe: Hm? Hey, what are they doing out here?
Raine: Oh, I decided to move the girls out here so I could care for them while keeping an eye on him. I‚Äôm worried. They haven‚Äôt had anything to eat or drink in over a day.
Sythe: Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll make sure this bastard tells us how to wake them up.
Raine: I hope you‚Äôre right. Thank you for staying with us. I know the others hadn‚Äôt exactly been‚Ä¶ grateful. But if it weren‚Äôt for you, we‚Äôd all be dead back when our village was attacked.Sythe: Oh! Uh‚Ä¶ thanks! It‚Äôs not really a big deal. I couldn‚Äôt let you guys die.
Raine: It is a big deal! It‚Äôs because of us you were labelled a traitor! We haven‚Äôt been very kind to you in return. Yet you‚Äôre still here caring over two human girls. You‚Äôre a good person, Sythe.
Sythe: Thanks. I appreciate that, Raine.
Sythe: Though, to be honest, the choice wasn‚Äôt as hard as you might think.
Raine: Oh?
Raine: I wasn‚Äôt exactly thrilled to be on the front lines acting as fodder in the first place. Believe it or not, before all this war nonsense got started I had my hopes of being a diplomat.
Raine: A diplomat? Really?
Sythe: Is that so hard to believe?
Raine: Well‚Ä¶ I mean, you must admit, most of the times I‚Äôve seen you, you‚Äôve been in a loincloth.
Sythe: Hah! I see your point. I guess I don‚Äôt quite look the part. But I wasn‚Äôt always like this!Sythe: When I was young, I was fascinated by human culture. I wanted to get to know everything about our weird hairless neighbours.
Sythe: Even spent a summer living in a human village once, if you can believe it. This was back when the borders were more open, of course. Even just a decade ago, things were a lot friendlier between our kind and theirs.
Sythe: Er‚Ä¶ I mean, b-between my kind and theirs! Not‚Ä¶ of course you aren‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Sorry.
Raine: It‚Äôs alright, Sythe.
Raine: Honest mistake.
Sythe: Ahem! Anyway‚Ä¶ I learned everything I could about humans.
Sythe: That‚Äôs not to say I didn‚Äôt care about my own culture, mind you! I am a proud wolf, through and through!
Sythe: But there were certain things I admired about humans. Freakishly long lives, education‚Ä¶ attitudes regarding women. Even my name. Originally, it was the Keidran word for the same tool, but humans couldn‚Äôt pronounce it. So I changed it to the human equivalent:
[sythe]
Raine: Uh‚Ä¶ Sythe‚Ä¶ you know it‚Äôs spelled wrong, right?
Sythe: W‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù
Raine: It normally has a ‚Äúc‚Äù in it. S-c-y-t-h-e.
Sythe: N-no, no it doesn‚Äôt! It‚Ä¶Raine: Then again, it‚Äôs your name. If you wanted to spell it that way, it‚Äôs fine. Are‚Ä¶ you alright, Sythe?
Raine: Sythe?
Sythe: Yes! I meant to spell it that way!
Raine: Yip!
Sythe: Sorry‚Ä¶ Uh‚Ä¶ where were we?
Raine: Y-you being a diplomat?
Raine: (thoughts) Did I just bark?
Sythe: Right, right. Well, not much else to say. Obviously it didn‚Äôt pan out. Templars had a coup. Borders were closed. I got sent off on an arranged marriage with a tiger.
Raine: You mean that girl who ran away with Trace, right?
Sythe: Yep, that was her. Heh. She must have really hated me. Guess I can‚Äôt blame her.
Sythe: I sometimes wonder what happened to Flora. The last time I saw her, she was running off with Trace and that Basitin toward the coast. Sadly‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm afraid she might not even be alive anymore.
Raine: What? Why?
Sythe: Well‚Ä¶ Last I heard, two assassins were sent after their group.
Zen: (in Keidran) Wait a minute! You guys are talking about Keith‚Äôs group of friends!Sythe: (in Keidran) You were awake this whole time?!
Zen: (in Keidran) It was your fianc√©e we were sent after?!
Sythe: (in Keidran) You were one of the assassins my uncle sent to kill Flora?!
Zen: (in Keidran) Your uncle sent assassins after your own fianc√©e?!
Raine: Hey! Guys!
Raine: Calm down! What‚Äôs he talking about, Sythe? You‚Äôre both speaking Keidran too fast for me to keep up.
Sythe: This is the guy! When Flora ran off with Trace, the wolves thought the humans might be forging an alliance with the felines in secret. This is one of the bastards they sent to kill her!
Zen: ‚ÄúKill‚Äù?
Zen: (in Keidran) No, wait! We did not kill them! I can explain‚Äî
Sythe: Save it!
Sythe: (in Keidran) I don‚Äôt want to hear any lies from you. And it doesn‚Äôt matter. As much as I wish Flora was alright, what matters right now is the girls. They haven‚Äôt woken up since yesterday, and I want to know what you did to them! You‚Äôd better have a cure for it!
Zen: (in Keidran) Yes, I know how to make a cure for them. But considering that it‚Äôs the only thing keeping me alive, and I‚Äôm the only thing that can keep them alive‚Ä¶ I think you should listen to me.Zen: ‚Ä¶And then, the white dragon flew off after defeating the shadow dragon! That‚Äôs when my brother joined up with your friends. From there, they stumbled upon a guy who happened to have a ship to sail them across the ocean to the lands of the Basitin!
Zen: And I know all of this because of the special telepathic mental connection that my brother and I share!
Zen: Okay, that‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt sound quite as good as it did in my head.
Sythe: It sounded completely insane! Did you honestly expect us to buy that nonsense? Your brother joining them doesn‚Äôt even make sense! Think about it: what kind of complete half-wit would just let a guy join them right after that person tried to kill them? That person would have to be pretty stupid. Like, really dumb.
Flora: I‚Ä¶ suddenly have the strangest urge to hit my ex-fianc√©.Narration: Meanwhile, on the other side of the link‚Ä¶
Keith: Natani, I really don‚Äôt think all this is necessary. I feel fine!
Natani: Yeah, right. Not long ago you could barely walk. We have a lot of work to do.
Natani: I mean, just look at these flabby arms!
Keith: My arms look exactly the same!
Natani: Exactly! I know you have that natural girly figure, but you‚Äôre supposed to be a ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù now.
Keith: I do not have a girly figure!
Natani: Then throw a punch already! Or are your poor, girly arms just too weak to be sparring right n‚Äî
Natani: Gah! My face! Why the face?!
Keith: I‚Äî I thought you were ready!
Keith: I‚Äôm sorry! I didn‚Äôt mean to‚Äî
Natani: Gotcha!Natani: Oldest trick in the book. ‚ÄòEh, Keith?
Natani: ‚Ä¶Keith? Ah! I forgot you were weakened! I‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt mean to hit you that hard, really! Are you okay?
Keith: Y-yeah‚Ä¶
Keith: I‚Äôm alright.
Natani: Oh, good, for a minute I thought I‚Äôd‚Äî Argh!
Keith: You‚Äôre right! Oldest trick!
Flora: Not sure why I‚Äôd think about Sythe now of all times‚Ä¶ Mrrow?
Flora: Hey! What‚Äôs going on?! Stop it, you guys! Whatever‚Äôs wrong, you don‚Äôt have to fight!
Natani: Huh? ‚ÄúWrong?‚Äù
Flora: I‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt there?
Keith: No?
Flora: Well‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ nevermind, then, I guess.
Flora: SIGH‚Ä¶
Flora: Boys.
Keith: I guess maybe we did overdo it.
Natani: Er, yeah, maybe‚Ä¶ just a bit‚Ä¶
Zen: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶Natani?
Natani: Ah!Keith: Argh!
Natani: (thoughts) Oh, Zen! H-hey! Listen, I can explain‚Ä¶
Zen: (thoughts) Whatever it is, it can wait! I‚Äôm in a bit of a bind at the moment‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶literally.
Natani: (thoughts) What do you mean? What‚Äôs been going‚Ä¶
Natani: Snrk‚Ä¶
Zen: (thoughts) Natani, don‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Well well well, look who‚Äôs finally lost his clothes this time!
Zen: (thoughts) Oh, har har! Fine, I deserve that! But how ‚Äòbout we save it for when I‚Äôm not in mortal danger?
Natani: (thoughts) Mortal danger? Why didn‚Äôt you call for me sooner?!
Zen: (thoughts) I didn‚Äôt want you to worry unless you could help. It‚Äôd take too long to explain, look through my memories. But for now I need to talk to someone through you! Quickly!
Zen: Flora, wait!Zen: I know this is going to be really weird, but I need you to help me with something, quickly!
Flora: Yeah, sure, Natani. What is it? And‚Ä¶ wait, didn‚Äôt one of your eyes used to be grey before?
Zen: That‚Ä¶ nevermind that. Just listen!
Zen: (thoughts) I forgot how cute Flora was in person.
Zen: (thoughts) Focus, Zen.
Sythe: Great. Now he‚Äôs just staring off into space. I don‚Äôt know what he hopes to gain from this act.
Raine: He probably just wants a reason for us not to hurt him.
Sythe: A crazy story about imaginary friends isn‚Äôt helping his case. He‚Äôs a magic-user. He‚Äôs dangerous.
Sythe: Sure, we only found drained mana crystals in his stuff, but who knows what else he might have hidden?
Raine: Wait! You found mana crystals when you searched him?!
Sythe: Well‚Ä¶ yeah, but they were dead. Why?
Raine: Even an ‚Äúempty‚Äù mana crystal is useful! The crystal itself can be ground up for runecrafting, circles‚Ä¶ I might be able to fix my shackle! I‚Äôll be right back!
Sythe: Well‚Ä¶ at least she‚Äôs happier. But it still doesn‚Äôt help our current situation! Maybe I should just wait and let Red handle this guy. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd love t‚Äî
Zen: Your ponytail looks stupid!Sythe: Alright, that‚Äôs it! I‚Äôve had it with that attitude of yours!
Zen: Wait, wait! That wasn‚Äôt me!
Zen: I was quoting Flora.
Sythe: W‚Ä¶ what?
Zen: It‚Äôs what she said, wasn‚Äôt it? When you two first met. She was angry at the arranged marriage. She called your ponytail stupid.
Sythe: But that‚Ä¶ y-you could have guessed that!
Zen: She also says the whole way back she tried knocking it off your shoulder when you weren‚Äôt looking. And that the first night she stole your fancy clothes and made you go the rest of the way in a loincloth. Guess you still haven‚Äôt found them?
Sythe: Alright, stop it! How could you possibly know that?! Did you torture her for information before you killed her?
Zen: Oh, yeah, sure! We always ask our targets irrelevant trivia questions about their pasts before we take them out. It‚Äôs in the assassin‚Äôs handbook, under ‚Äúpointless‚Äù.
Sythe: Enough with the sarcasm! Even if there‚Äôs some truth to all this, you still attacked us! Do you expect me to just let you go?!
Zen: I‚Äôd settle for not killing me? You‚Äôre going to need me for the sake of those girls. They‚Äôre worse off than you realize.Zen: I must go now. Thank you so much for your help, my dear.
Flora: Uh‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre welcome‚Ä¶ I guess.
Keith: ‚Ä¶Natani?
Zen: Ah, right. You.
Zen: Sorry, it‚Äôs Zen right now. I needed to chat with Flora so I had to borrow Natani.
Keith: You can just‚Ä¶ do that?
Zen: If we allow it, sure. I need to get back, though.
Zen: But first‚Ä¶
Zen: Before I go‚Ä¶ listen up, short stuff!
Zen: Natani‚Äôs been through a lot of crap, and the last thing he needs is more. He won‚Äôt admit it but he‚Äôs vulnerable, and he‚Äôs put a lot of trust onto you. So just remember: I‚Äôm watching you. And if you betray that trust, I will feel it. And it won‚Äôt matter how cute you are, I‚Äôll find you.
Keith: Uh‚Ä¶ ‚Äúcute?‚Äù
Zen: Huh? Wait, I meant ‚Äúfar‚Äù! How far you are! I, uh, I need to go bye!
Keith: W‚Ä¶ what just happened?
Natani: Ha! Emotions flow through the link both ways.
Natani: My feelings become his feelings. Serves him right for going through me to threaten you.Narration: Some time later‚Ä¶
Red: Man! I slept like a rock!
Red: Ah! You out here, fur-face? Did I miss anything while I was out?
Red: ‚Ä¶
Red: He‚Äôs awake and you didn‚Äôt tell me?!
Zen: Uh‚Ä¶ Morning. Coffee?
Red: And you untied one of his hands to give him coffee?!
Sythe: Relax, Red. He told us where to find his stuff nearby, including the coffee. And his hand is only untied because he just finished making what we needed.
Red: Wait, you mean‚Ä¶?
Sythe: Yeah. Raine‚Äôs over with the girls treating them right now.
Red: What, really?! He just gave it up like that?! I can‚Äôt believe it! I was sure we‚Äôd have to beat it out of him! What a sucker!
Red: Now we can take care of this guy and finally get on the road again!
Sythe: No. We can‚Äôt yet. There‚Äôs a new complication.
Red: Huh? What do you mean by that?
Sythe: He‚Äôs made some odd claims while you were out. He says he knows our friends, but more importantly‚Ä¶
Sythe: This guy ‚Äî Zen ‚Äî claims the poison he used on the girls isn‚Äôt something that can just be fixed with some plants. They need a real healer. While his quick fix will wake them up for now, unless they continue to take it regularly they won‚Äôt wake up again by the next morning. In other words, we need him.Zen: (thoughts) And now they‚Äôre back to arguing in human again.
Natani: (thoughts) I don‚Äôt think the red one is buying your antidote story.
Zen: (thoughts) Well what else could I do? I had to make the cure!
Zen: (thoughts) They would have woken up eventually.
Zen: (thoughts) I‚Äôm lucky that second-rate ‚Äúeternal sleep‚Äù poison lasted as long as it did! At least this way, they think they need me to keep making it, and all those phony steps will keep them guessing how it‚Äôs done. I just have to buy myself a little more time!
Red: Just give me ten minutes with him!
Sythe: Red, think for a minute. It‚Äôs the only thing keeping him alive, and he knows it! He might just give us another poison recipe if he thinks he‚Äôll die either way!
Red: Greah! Let‚Äôs just see if the girls really wake up first. Where are they anyway? Their tent was empty.
Sythe: Well, they were out here earlier, but we wanted to wake them up away from‚Ä¶ him.
Red: That‚Äôs a good idea. Maren dislikes Keidran probably as much as I do! Good thing Raine‚Äôs at least got most of her humanness back.
Red: Can‚Äôt imagine how she‚Äôd react otherwise!
Sythe: Uh‚Ä¶Raine: (thoughts) I wish I knew what was in this stuff I‚Äôm giving them. I‚Äôve read books on botany, but this‚Ä¶ I have no idea what this is. Smells funny. But everything smells funny with this nose. ‚Ä¶ Now I can‚Äôt stop noticing the giant dog nose constantly in front of my face.
Maren: Uuuurgh‚Ä¶
Raine: Ah!
Raine: I-it‚Äôs working! Maren?
Maren: Ugh~! My head‚Ä¶ What did I drink last night? And why does it taste like I just chewed on a bag of tea leaves?
Raine: Just relax, Maren. Take it slow.
Maren: Raine? Is that you?
Maren: Why do you sound so‚Äî
Raine: You‚Äôre awake! I‚Äôm so relieved‚Äî
Maren: KYAAAAAAHHH!
Raine: Maren, wait!
Maren: Get back! Back! You filthy beast! Think you can sneak up on us?!
Maren: I‚Äôll teach you to try and
Red: Woah woah woah! Relax! She‚Äôs okay!Maren: ‚ÄúRaine‚Äù? You expect me to believe that?
Red: I know it sounds crazy‚Ä¶ But just look at her! The frumpy blue clothes? That weird accent?
Red: And do you know anyone else with freakishly long silver hair? It‚Äôs Raine!
Raine: It‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt tell you before. You were the first friends I ever had.
Raine: I was afraid of how you‚Äôd react if you knew I was really like‚Ä¶ this. I had so much fun travelling with you guys. I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd hoped‚Äî
Karen: WAAAAAHHH!
Raine: Eh?
Karen: DOGGY!!
Raine: BLARG!
Maren: Karen!
Karen: Look at how fluffy she is! Can we keep her?!
Maren: No, you can‚Äôt keep Raine! She‚Äôs not a pet!
Red: So you admit it‚Äôs her.
Karen: Even her tail is floofy!
Red: Karen, no! Don‚Äôt grab that! Trust me!
Red: See, she‚Äôs nice, Maren. And we owe her. She saved all of us, seeing through that assassin‚Äôs illusion. And she took care of both you girls while you were poisoned.
Maren: Eh, fine, whatever.
Karen: Wait‚Ä¶ We were poisoned?
Red: Yeah, if it weren‚Äôt for Raine stepping in, you two probably would have been left out here to die.
Karen: D‚Ä¶ die?Red: Well, I‚Äôll let you girls freshen up. I‚Äôm sure you need it.
Maren: What‚Äôs that supposed to mean?
Red: Er, uh‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶
Maren: No, you‚Äôre right. We‚Äôll be back. Come on, Karen.
Red: Well‚Ä¶ That went better than expected.
Raine: I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ maren barely looked at me after you explained the situation.
Raine: I don‚Äôt think things will ever be the same between us.
Red: Nah! That‚Äôs just how Maren is. Emotional one minute, distant the next. Don‚Äôt take it personally. She‚Äôs always been like that since Tan‚Äî er‚Ä¶ Since‚Ä¶ we were kids.
Raine: Really? I knew you guys grew up together in that village. You‚Äôve known each other a long time. ‚Ä¶Were the two of you ever‚Ä¶?
Red: What? Together? Ah-hahaha! Me and Maren! A couple! I can‚Äôt even picture that! That would just be‚Ä¶ weird!
Red: Plus, I‚Äôm pre-e-etty sure we‚Äôre cousins.
Raine: Cousins?!
Red: Probably. It was a small village. But even if we‚Äôre not‚Ä¶ I could never look at her in that way.
Raine: I see. I‚Äôd wondered why you‚Äôve never shown any interest. Especially since‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always thought Maren was pretty attractive.
Red: Attractive? Pfff, I guess. In a sort of Ice Queen kind of way. Eugh.Red: ‚Ä¶
Red: Maren will come around, you‚Äôll see.
Raine: Huh? Oh, no. It‚Äôs not that. I was thinking about‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ This:
Raine: My shackle. I‚Ä¶ I fixed it.
Red: What? Really?!
Red: It‚Äôs working again? That‚Äôs awesome!
Raine: Yeah. It was simple, once I had access to Zen‚Äôs stuff.
Raine: ‚Ä¶
Red: Okay‚Ä¶ if it‚Äôs fixed, why don‚Äôt you seem happy about it? And why are you still all‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ wolfish?
Raine: Do you remember what I said this does? It suppresses magic. I know you don‚Äôt want us to keep Zen. We can‚Äôt trust him. Well‚Ä¶
Raine: This can suppress Zen‚Äôs magic just as well as mine. It won‚Äôt make him harmless, but‚Äî
Red: ‚ÄîEven if he pulls magic out his ass he won‚Äôt be able to use his little tricks on us again! Brilliant!
Red: But‚Ä¶ wait, that means‚Ä¶
Raine: Yes.
Raine: It means I‚Äôll be stuck‚Ä¶ like this.Red: Raine, you don‚Äôt have to do that. If we just keep the guy away from crystals‚Äî
Raine: ‚ÄîEven without crystals, black magic is always an option for the desperate. And besides‚Ä¶
Raine: ‚Ä¶Maybe this way, it‚Äôll be safe enough to let him live.
Red: SIGH‚Ä¶
Red: You really are too nice, even when it comes to someone who doesn‚Äôt deserve it.
Red: I know how much this means to you. Are you really willing to give it up?
Raine: If it means we can all travel safely together, then yes. I am.
Red: You‚Äôre a braver person than me. Being stuck as a Keidran‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be willing to do the same. Listen Raine‚Ä¶
Red: It doesn‚Äôt matter, okay? I know you‚Äôre really human on the inside. The girls will realize that too, in time. You‚Äôre one of us.
Red: We won‚Äôt think less of you just ‚Äòcause you‚Äôve got some fur and a tail now. And if anyone does, I‚Äôll beat some sense into them, alright?
Red: Now come on, no moping. Let‚Äôs go tell the others to pack up. I think it‚Äôs about time we finally hit the road again.Red: Hey! We‚Äôre back! And it worked! The girls are washing up now. I think we‚Äôre just about ready to leave this dump. How‚Äôs our ‚Äúguest‚Äù doing?
Sythe: He hasn‚Äôt given me any trouble. In fact, he‚Äî
[ZEN SYTHE WAS HERE]
Sythe: NOOOO‚Äî‚ÄîOOOOO!
Zen: (in Keidran) You know‚Ä¶
Zen: (in Keidran) You guys really need to learn how to tie a rope. That, and keep better track of your squirrels.
Nibbly: ??
Sythe: Wha‚Äî?! Mrs. Nibbly, you traitor!
Red: Don‚Äôt move!
Zen: (in Keidran) Hey, relax! I could have run, but I didn‚Äôt! As I said before, I have every intention of travelling with you! I just saved you the trouble of untying me!
Zen: (in Keidran) The whole point of taking this job was so I could afford safe passage to reach my brother. But since we‚Äôre all going the same direction, there‚Äôs no need now!
Natani: (thoughts) I still think breaking free was stupid. They‚Äôll trust you less now.
Zen: (thoughts) You‚Äôd be surprised. A little roguish charm can go a long way towards building trust in the long run.Zen: (in Keidran) It‚Äôs going to be a long journey, and it‚Äôll be hard to carry me hog-tied the entire way. I swear on my life that I will not cause you or your friends any trouble along the way, Miss Raine.
Raine: I‚Äôd like to believe that. If you truly wish to build trust with us, you can start by letting us put this on you.
Zen: (in Keidran) Going to shackle me, huh? I suppose that‚Äôs reasonable, though not very effective with just one.
Zen: (in Keidran) But very well! If you insist, shackle me!
Red: Put it on his ankle, so he can‚Äôt mess with it while we walk.
Red: And you, don‚Äôt move!
Natani: Zen, wait! There are runes on that thing!
Natani: Are you sure this is‚ÄîNatani: Zen?!
Natani: Ah‚Ä¶!

Chapter 18 COMING HOMENarration: Many days later‚Ä¶
Flora: Hey, look! I can see mountains! We must be getting close to the mainland!
Trace: Eric was right, the currents made coming back a lot faster. Still, it felt way longer to me, especially after‚Ä¶ all that‚Äôs happened.
Flora: Mr‚Äôeah‚Ä¶ Speaking of which, how‚Äôs your cheek doing?
Trace: Oh, i-it‚Äôs fine. It doesn‚Äôt hurt anymore, but I figured I‚Äôd keep this on. Might help make me less recognizable in the village.
Flora: I still can‚Äôt believe Keith did that! What a jerk!
Trace: He was just upset. I don‚Äôt blame him.
Flora: Well I do!
Flora: Being scared and angry is no excuse to start lashing out at other people! Especially friends!
Trace: Sigh‚Ä¶ Yeah, well, I‚Äôm the last person who can criticize him for doing something like that.
Trace: I just hope we can find something to help Natani, for both their sakes.Keith: You couldn‚Äôt help Laura, you can‚Äôt help Natani‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt believe you were once Grand Templar. What good are you now? You‚Äôre useless!
Trace: ‚Ä¶Maybe he‚Äôs right.
Flora: Trace, don‚Äôt say that! Keith was way out of line! He‚Äôs just taking it out on you because it‚Äôs how he feels about himself right now.
Trace: He‚Äôs not wrong though, is he? What good have I done? Ever since waking up all I‚Äôve managed to do is put you guys in danger.
Trace: I have power, but it only seems to work when I‚Äôm not thinking about it, and half the time it‚Äôs hurting my friends. And everyone keeps telling me the world‚Äôs falling apart because of me.
Flora: Trace‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not your fault.
Trace: Isn‚Äôt it, though?
Trace: Not being able to remember doesn‚Äôt make me innocent.
Trace: I am the person who corrupted the Templar. I think facing up to that fact is my best hope of retaining myself if my memories ever do return. But to do that I need to learn all I can about who I am.
Trace: And that begins at Edinmire.Keith: Alright, Natani. We should be landing soon. Kathrin will take care of you until I get back.
Keith: You know, at the time I resented Alaric for what he did. Sacrificing himself like that just to help someone like me. But now, I‚Äôm grateful.
Keith: There‚Äôd be nothing I could do for you as ‚ÄúKeith the Banished‚Äù.
Keith: But as a general‚Ä¶ The Templar may be corrupt, but humans are still technically Basitin allies.
Keith: What do you think? Pretty good, hm?
Keith: I‚Äôm sure the other generals would say this was an abuse of power, but the truth is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never been a very good Basitin.
Keith: But I‚Äôm not going to wallow in self-pity. Not this time. I know you‚Äôre still in there, and I‚Äôll get you back. See you soon.
Natani: ‚Ä¶Keith.Flora: We‚Äôre here!
Trace: H-hey! Hold on!
Trace: Flora!
Flora: Mrrrah!
Flora: I know, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself! It just feels so good to finally be back on dry land again! Oh, ground, how I‚Äôve missed you! Or‚Ä¶ at least the docks attached to you. Close enough!
Flora: I did make sure to check first. I didn‚Äôt see any Templar. Although‚Ä¶ actually, now that I think about it‚Ä¶
Flora: ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt see very many people here at all. Weird‚Ä¶ where is everyone?
Trace: Well there are still dock workers, at least. That guy back there helped bring our ship in, after all. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll find out more in the village.Trace: Oh, hey, there you are, Keith. We were just waiting on‚Ä¶
Trace: ‚Ä¶yooou.
Trace: I‚Ä¶ I guess Keith has his own entourage now.
Flora: Eh, just let him go, Trace.
Flora: He‚Äôs got his own crusade to worry about. And three Basitins would attract a lot of unwanted attention anyway.
Trace: Yeah I know, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I was hoping the three of us would be travelling together, like the old days.
Flora: Aww! It‚Äôll be okay, dear. Hehe! You‚Äôre cute when you‚Äôre sentimental!Trace: Ack! Flora! We‚Äôre supposed to be inconspic‚Äî !
Flora: So cute!
Lynn: Now. Sir‚Ä¶ I am.. aware your previous travels through human cities have been less than ideal. I‚Äôve worked to ensure this will not be the case this.. time.
Lynn: I have prepared all the proper documents for our first foray within human lands.
Lynn: I have also created a map of the area from memory, and marked possible places that may help your wolf friend.
Keith: From‚Ä¶ memory?
Lynn: Yes, sir, the Templar brought many new maps on their last island visit. I had a.. few major settlements committed to memory.
Lynn: Is something the matter, sir?
Keith: Er, no. This is great, Lynn. Actually, I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ worried about my friends.
Keith: I wish they had someone like you to help them as well.
Lynn: I anticipated you might say that! I‚Äôve.. already prepared similar documents, and would be happy to keep my eye on them as well. Playing go-between is my primary duty, after all. I am glad to serve.
Keith: Oh, well, if you can, that would be perf‚Äî wait, hang on‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt remember signing any of these. Did‚Ä¶ Did you forge my sig‚Äî
Madelyn: ‚Ä¶Wow, I thought I was good.Flora: It‚Äôs strange‚Ä¶ being back here.
[Map of Edinmire]
Trace: ‚ÄúBack here‚Äù? Wait, you‚Äôve been here before?
Flora: Mmhm. You know I was once a slave. Edinmire is the closest settlement to tiger territory. This‚Ä¶ was my home.
Trace: I didn‚Äôt know that. Why didn‚Äôt you ever mention it before?
Flora: Sigh‚Ä¶ I dunno. It‚Äôs weird to talk about those days. Feels like a lifetime ago. But this place‚Ä¶ it looks and smells exactly how I remember it. If you followed this stream a ways, you‚Äôd eventually reach my fath‚Ä¶ my master‚Äôs farm.
Trace: Flora, if this is hard for you, you don‚Äôt have to come with me. I only plan to look around.
Flora: No!
Flora: After what happened on that island, I‚Äôm never leaving your side again!
Trace: Erg! Flora‚Ä¶ My spine!Flora: I‚Äôm sorry! Are you sure you‚Äôre okay?
Trace: I said I‚Äôm fine! Really!
Trace: Though‚Ä¶ maybe someday you could get those claws trimmed down just a little?
Flora: Oh! I actually know a place for that! And that‚Äôs exactly why you need me with you! I know Edinmire like the stripes on my tail!
Flora: Oh. Then again, I suppose a trim won‚Äôt matter.
Flora: Now that we‚Äôre back in human lands, we‚Äôll need to pretend to be servant and master again. And that means keeping my claws to myself anyway.
Flora: If I could just pass as human, it wouldn‚Äôt matter. But I‚Äôll never be able to hide what I am completely.
Trace: I‚Äôm sorry, Flora. I know you hate doing this.
Trace: I recall you mentioned once that you dreamt of being human. Seeing where you were raised, I‚Äôm starting to understand why.
Trace: But listen‚Ä¶ What you are isn‚Äôt wrong. I‚Äôd never want you to change, not even the claws, if you don‚Äôt want to. We may have to pretend otherwise, but I love you, stripes and all.
Flora: I know. I love you too. Though it‚Äôs not going to stay secret for very long if someone sees us like this.Flora: You know, I think you‚Äôll like Edinmire. Despite being near a Templar college, it‚Äôs actually a fairly Keidran friendly village.
Trace: ‚ÄúKeidran friendly‚Äù? Uh, Flora‚Ä¶
Flora: There are even Keidran-owned shops. I know one tavern that serves amazing tiger cuisine. Mmmm‚Ä¶
Trace: Flora‚Ä¶ I really think you should see this.

Flora: I just can‚Äôt believe it. I mean‚Ä¶ wolves and humans have always fought, but‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd ever really happen. Not officially. Maybe you were right. It isn‚Äôt safe here.
Keiren: Oi, you two!
Flora: Ah?!Keiren: Oh, sorry if I gave your girl a fright, pal.
Keiren: If it‚Äôs the board that‚Äôs got her spooked, no worries. Folks have no love for wolves these days, but our feline neighbours are still welcome, ‚Äòspecially now. I‚Äôm just here to tell you to keep the main road clear. We‚Äôve got a procession coming through soon, so if you‚Äôre here for that, you need to be down in Shepherd‚Äôs Square.
Trace: It‚Äôs just a guard. I think it‚Äôs okay, Flora.
Keiren: W-wait! Did he just say‚Ä¶ it can‚Äôt be! You back there! Did he just call you ‚ÄúFlora‚Äù?
Flora: Uh‚Ä¶ maybe? Do we know each other?

Flora: No! Keep away from me, Kei! We need to go, now!
Keiren: Wait! I know we didn‚Äôt part on good terms. But after all this time, you can‚Äôt just run again! Not until we talk!
Trace: Hey! She told you to leave her alone!
Keiren: Oi! I don‚Äôt know who you think you are, but I‚Äôm guard captain of Edinmire, boy. Flora and I go way back, so butt out!
Trace: I said back off.
Flora: Stop! Please, don‚Äôt hurt him.
Keiren: Hurt me?
Keiren: This runt should be the one worried about getting hurt.
Trace: R-runt?!
Keiren: Flora‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I have to finish my route. If it were any other day, I‚Äôd drop everything, but‚Ä¶
Keiren: Listen, I know you don‚Äôt trust me, but please‚Ä¶ wait for me at the tavern down the road. I‚Äôll return. And alone, I swear. Just‚Ä¶ promise me you won‚Äôt leave until I get back. Please.
Flora: Kei‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ okay. I owe you at least that much.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Lynn: I have returned, sir. I‚Äôve also discovered that many humans have gathered near the center of town. In an area called Shepherd‚Äôs Square.
Keith: I see. That would explain why we haven‚Äôt run into anyone yet.

Madelyn: Look, sir! There‚Äôs the local healer! Oooo, I can‚Äôt wait to meet my first native human!
Apothecary: Finally, customers! Yes! Yes! Welcome! How can I help yyyyouuuu‚Ä¶?
Keith: Yes. We‚Äôre Basitins. Listen, I‚Äôll make this brief: my friend is sick. It‚Äôs something magic, and I believe it involves the soul. Can you help us?
Apothecary: Well, I‚Ä¶ I suppose I could take a look. Though I‚Äôm not familiar with Basitins. Which of you is injured?
Keith: No, it‚Äôs not one of us. He‚Äôs a wolf, and he‚Äôs on a ship right now, so if you could just‚Äî
Madelyn: Wow, humans are huge jerks![Market]
Flora: Sigh‚Ä¶ Of all the people to run into, it had to be Keiren. At least I don‚Äôt think he recognized you. No one‚Äôs tailed us to the tavern.
[155]
Trace: Yeah, I think he had his attention elsewhere at the time‚Ä¶ hmph. So who is this ‚ÄúKey‚Äù guy?
Flora: Kei. And‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs complicated.
[RIFTWALL]
Flora: He was the son of my old master. And‚Ä¶ my best friend for a long, long time. When we were young, the fact that I was a Keidran never seemed to bother him. In fact, he stood up for me several times. But as we got older Kei‚Ä¶ changed.
Flora: He would act differently towards me when around his friends. That‚Äôs how it started. It happened slowly, but‚Ä¶ Well, to make a long story short, by the end he was hunting me when I ran.
Trace: I‚Äôm sorry, Flora. That must have been hard.
Flora: I don‚Äôt trust him. But if he‚Äôs guard captain now, he could help us. Either way, I need to talk to him.
Adira: Ahem! Are you two planning to stand in my doorway all day or are you coming in?
Flora: Eep!Adira: Welcome to Riftwall East. I‚Äôm Adira.
Flora: Oh, hi. I‚Äôm Flora. And this is Trrr‚Äî Er, I mean‚Ä¶

Flora: Trace! Kei?!
Trace: You know I can‚Äôt make up names!
Flora: But of all the names you know, why his?!
Trace: He was the last person we were talking about! I panicked!
Flora: I can‚Äôt call you Kei, though!
Adira: Uh, you guys‚Ä¶ know I‚Äôm still here, right? I didn‚Äôt leave or anything.
Adira: Relax. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me who you are. You could claim to be Princess Reni for all I care. I‚Äôve survived here by knowing not to stick my nose in other‚Äôs business.
Adira: I just get people drunk.Adira: Well, make yourselves at home. You certainly have your pick of seating. Hey, Maeve! You back there? Need a couple drinks! Sigh‚Ä¶ where is that girl?
Flora: ‚Ä¶There‚Äôs no one here.
Adira: Yeah‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt remind me.
Adira: Business hasn‚Äôt been what it used to be, ever since we lost our main attraction. But it‚Äôs been particularly empty today.
Flora: ‚ÄúMain attraction‚Äù?
Adira: I‚Äôll show you.
[‚Üê EAST]
Adira: This is what the tavern was named after. Once upon a time this hallway would take you directly to our sister tavern far in the west.
Adira: Long ago, when these were Keidran lands, they used walls like these to avoid humans. Ironic. There are even stories that once, this gate could lead you to other Riftwalls, in other places.

Adira: But ever since this war business started, it‚Äôs gone dark. I don‚Äôt want to think about what that might mean for our sister tavern. Sometimes I think I can see things moving inside, and hear whispering at night, but nothing ever comes through.Flora: Man, that archway gave me the creeps. It felt like I was being watched when we were in front of it.
Trace: You‚Äôve never seen it before?
Flora: No. I must have passed by this tavern loads of time as a kid, but I never thought about it.
Flora: Still, being up here is a good spot to wait. We‚Äôll be able to see Kei coming, just in case he brings any unwanted company.
Trace: I still don‚Äôt like the idea of waiting for this guy. I think we should just get what we came for and leave this weird town as soon as possible.
Flora: Trace, I‚Äôm still not exactly clear on how we were planning on getting to your money.

Trace: Oh, well‚Ä¶
Trace: I was going to play it by ear, but basically I just planned to get there, scout around a bit ‚Äî you know, make sure the coast is clear ‚Äî then enter the house undetected through a back window or something, and make off with everything we need. Simple!
Trace: I mean it is my property after all, right? So it‚Äôs not really breaking in or stealing. And I‚Äôve been gone for months. Why would Templar be guarding an empty building after all this time? It‚Äôs the perfect plan!
Flora: Trace, do you know what an estate is?Trace: Alright! Maybe it wasn‚Äôt the most well thought out plan. I guess I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable waiting around in this place. Feels like we‚Äôre being watched.
Flora: Huh?
Flora: Don‚Äôt look now, but you might be right.
Adira: Maeve, what are you doing up there? Take them the drinks.
Maeve: Mommy! There‚Äôs a tiger!
Adira: I know there is, dear. Just give it to them.
Maeve: I‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt!
Adira: Sigh‚Ä¶ hold on.
Adira: Ah‚Ä¶ sorry about all that. My server‚Äôs decided she wants to be shy today.
Adira: This is my daughter, Maeve. She‚Äôs not normally like this, but we don‚Äôt serve many non-humans.
Flora: She‚Äôs afraid of her own kind?
Adira: Oh, not at all. She‚Äôs just grown up surrounded by humans, so it‚Äôs what she‚Äôs familiar with.
Adira: She‚Äôs actually a fan of tigers, which might be part of the problem.
Flora: Aw! Well, nice to meet you, Maeve.Flora: What‚Äôs it like raising a child in a human village?
Adira: Oh, not nearly as bad as you might think. Maybe it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre so far east, but we‚Äôve rarely had much trouble with the human folk. Even after this war nonsense began. You always get the occasional ‚Äúfleabag‚Äù comment, but I ignore it. Most are decent. And that‚Äôs what I try to teach Maeve: look to the good ones.
Flora: That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a surprising opinion to hear, especially from someone who has to deal with people all day. Is she your first?
Adira: Yup! She‚Äôs my baby ‚Äì one and only.
Flora: So cute. I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be having my first soon, too.
Adira: Ah, I see, Congrats!
Adira: I thought so when I first saw you, but I didn‚Äôt want to presume. Is the father going to be joining you here, or‚Ä¶?
Flora: Oh, no, he‚Äôs‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs complicated.
Maeve: !Flora: You‚Äôre very lucky to have such a cute‚Äî Eh?
Trace: What is it, Flora?
Flora: I hear something coming this way! Lots of somethings.
Adira: Ah, here they come. Right on schedule.
Trace: Templar?
Flora: Wait‚Ä¶
Flora: Those aren‚Äôt Templar! They‚Äôre‚Äî!Adira: Never thought I‚Äôd see the day that tiger nomads stroll through Edinmire. These are strange times.
Adira: Maeve was so disappointed when I told her she had to stay here and miss everything. Hopefully, meeting you and seeing this has made up for it a little.
Flora: I don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶ This is a human village. What are tigers doing here?
Adira: I‚Ä¶ wait, you don‚Äôt know? I figured that was the whole reason why you were here! I thought you were like‚Ä¶ an advanced scout or something, and that‚Äôs why you were being all secretive.
Adira: If you‚Äôre really not aware, the humans want to begin peaceful relations with felids. They invited them here.
Flora: W-what?! Why‚Ä¶ why now?
Adira: Why else? The war. I can‚Äôt say for certain, but I suspect the Templar do not want to fight a war on two fronts.
Flora: Trace! I‚Ä¶ I need to go and see this for myself! I know it‚Äôs dangerous, but they‚Äôre my people, and I don‚Äôt trust the Templar.
Trace: O-oh‚Ä¶ okay, we can go, sure.
Trace: I guess that means we won‚Äôt be meeting Kei after all. What a sha‚Äî
Keiren: Flora!
Keiren: You‚Äôre here! Sorry to keep you waiting!
Trace: (thoughts) Gah, dang it!Keiren: Listen‚Ä¶
Keiren: I can‚Äôt stay. I still gotta escort these tiger folk to town square. But if you want to‚Äî
Flora: We‚Äôll come with you! Right, Tr‚Ä¶ er‚Ä¶ Sir?
Trace: Mrgh‚Ä¶ fine.
Trace: (thoughts) I‚Äôve got my eye on you, Kei. Don‚Äôt try anything.
Flora: Thank you for having us, Miss Adira. I‚Äôm sorry we can‚Äôt stick around. How much do we owe you?
Adira: Eh, it was just water, and you didn‚Äôt even drink any. Forget it, kid.
Flora: Oh! Thank you!
Flora: Well, we‚Äôd best be off‚Äî
Flora: Mrrow?‚Äù
Flora: Oh! Aw, Maeve!
Flora: I‚Äôm sorry, we have to leave. But I hope we see each other again! It was very nice to meet you!

Adira: Wow‚Ä¶ Maybe Mr. Big Bad Templar isn‚Äôt quite as bad as they say. Couldn‚Äôt be any worse than his acting. Not that I‚Äôd say that to his face.
Adira: Maeve, dear, I need to go to the market. Could you help mommy clean‚Äî Maeve?
Adira: (thoughts) Sigh‚Ä¶ Maeve. Trying to sneak off after the tigers, hm? That girl, I swear‚Ä¶
Adira: You‚Äôre going to be cleaning so many dishes when I catch up to you, Maeve.
[BACK IN 5 MINUTES]Flora: I don‚Äôt remember there being so many guards in Edinmire.
Keiren: This meeting is very important. We‚Äôre taking every precaution. But as long as you‚Äôre not a wolf, you don‚Äôt have anything to worry about.
Soldier: Eyes forward, Daniels!
Flora: But‚Ä¶ what about the wolves that already live in Edinmire? The servants and merchants, like Adira?
Keiren: Er, well‚Ä¶ At the moment, all canine keidran are being held at the guard barracks for now.
Flora: Wait, what?! You‚Äôre locking up every wolf in the city? Even the innocent ones? That‚Äôs horrible!
Keiren: Flora, it‚Äôs not that bad. This is just a temporary measure. The wolves declared war on us. We can‚Äôt let our guard down.
Flora: The ones living here didn‚Äôt declare war on anyone! It‚Äôs not right!
Keiren: Flora, you‚Äôre naive if you think the wolves here wouldn‚Äôt side with their kind in a heartbeat. They can‚Äôt change what they are.Keiren: A-anyway, on a lighter note‚Ä¶ Here, maybe this will make you feel better. I have something for you.
Flora: What is it?
[FLORA]
[104]
Keiren: They‚Äôre your papers. Everything that documented you as a slave of my family.
Flora: Is this your way of saying I still technically belong to you?
Keiren: W-what? No, no! Nothing like that!
Keiren: I‚Äôm giving them to you. Look underneath. It‚Äôs a letter of safe passage. The same kind that lets that tavern lady live and work here.
Keiren: I had it made ages ago, in case you‚Ä¶ ever came back.
Flora: I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ free?
Keiren: Yes, though you should still be careful. There will always be people who won‚Äôt care about a seal.
Keiren: Speaking of which‚Ä¶Keiren: Guards!
Trace: Hey!
Flora: Kei! What are you doing?!
Evil Aura: THEY KNOW! WE NEED TO GET AWAY RELEASE OUR MAGIC!
Evil Aura: USE IT! USE IT! USE IT! USE IT! USE IT! USE IT! USE IT! USE IT! USE IT! USE IT! USE IT! USE IT! USE IT! USE IT!
Keiren: Sir, as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve overheard, Flora is a free Keidran. I don‚Äôt know how she came to be in your possession, but I won‚Äôt allow you to keep her as your servant any longer. You will be held until we‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre not a threat to‚ÄîKeiren: F-Flora? Wha‚Äî
Flora: Keiren, tell your men to let. Him. Go.
Daniels: Hey! You can‚Äôt talk to the captain that way!
Keiren: No, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs alright, Daniels. Go back to‚Ä¶ whatever you were doing.
Keiren: Flora, I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm trying to help! This guy‚Äî
Flora: ‚ÄîHas done nothing! Something you‚Äôd know if you‚Äôd just asked me first. You haven‚Äôt changed, Kei. You were always deciding for me.
Keiren: Hey! That‚Äôs not fair! I‚Äôm trying to make up for what I‚Äôve done. I just didn‚Äôt know. So this guy, he‚Äôs‚Ä¶?
Flora: A friend. And I know how strange that sounds. It‚Äôs a long story. One I don‚Äôt feel like telling while your goons are holding him.
Soldier 1: ‚ÄúGoons‚Äù? Rude. Why is the captain letting a Keidran talk to him like that?
Soldier 2: Eh, probably under orders to play nice with the stripes while they‚Äôre here.
Flora: Now, if you really want to make up for before, start by not arresting my friends.Soldier: Sir, we can‚Äôt detect any mind control. We‚Äôve run a dispel just in case.
Keiren: I see‚Ä¶ Thank you.
Keiren: In that case, let him go.
Soldier: Yes, sir!
Keiren: There, no harm done. You okay there, pal? You look a bit sick.
Trace: I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ fine.
Keiren: Flora, I‚Ä¶ want to apologize again. Today has been pretty stressful and this position is still fairly new to me. Honestly, I was hoping to impress you ‚Äî be a hero, ya know, and I guess that‚Ä¶ kinda backfired.
Flora: I understand, Kei. Thank you.
Keiren: And I suppose I owe you an apology too.
Keiren: Sorry for the mix-up, bud. Any friend of Flora‚Äôs is a friend of mine.
Keiren: Just remember, though‚Ä¶ When it comes to Flora, I came first.
Keiren: Say, now that I actually get a good look at you‚Ä¶ You seem‚Ä¶ familiar. What did you say your name was, again?Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Keith: Sigh‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre getting nowhere.
Keith: Why does every magic user in this whole village slam their door in our faces?!
Madelyn: Sir, look!
Keith: Hm? Oh‚Ä¶ Wow‚Ä¶ look at all the Floras.
Keith: Floras everywhere‚Ä¶
Madelyn: ‚Ä¶‚ÄúFloras‚Äù sir?
Keith: Oh, right, you guys weren‚Äôt‚Ä¶ erm‚Ä¶ would have been funnier if Flora were here‚Ä¶ F-forget it. Let‚Äôs see if one of the tigers might help.Apothecary: E-excuse me‚Ä¶ sirs?
Keith: Huh? Oh, it‚Äôs you‚Ä¶ apothecary man.
Apothecary: Well, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not my name, but yes! Hello!
Apothecary: I-I would like to apologize for my behaviour earlier. I may have acted a bit‚Ä¶ rashly. These are‚Ä¶ difficult times to be trusting, what with the war and all.
Apothecary: But‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I realize, as a healer, it is my duty to aid those in need. Thus, I feel it is only right that I‚Ä¶ do so.
Keith: You‚Äôll really help us?
Apothecary: Yes! I‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôll certainly try. If you could just lead me to this wolf of yours‚Ä¶
Keith: Of course! Follow us, he‚Äôs right‚Äî
Lynn: Wait, general.
Keith: Huh? What is it, Lynn?
Lynn: Accelerated heart rate. Dilated pupils. Excessive perspiration. Something‚Äôs not.. right. I feel we are being deceived.
Madelyn: Don‚Äôt need all that to tell something‚Äôs up. We‚Äôre being watched. Three humans, at least.Keith: Anything you‚Äôd care to tell us, friend?
Apothecary: Look, I‚Ä¶ T-this wasn‚Äôt my idea!
Apothecary: I - I didn‚Äôt want to get involved. She made me!
Madelyn: She who?
Lynn: Sir, look out!
Apothecary: Eep!
Apothecary: Uuurgh‚Ä¶ Why me?
Seraphina: What a shame. I was really hoping you‚Äôd just lead us to the wolf, nice and easy.
Seraphina: I didn‚Äôt want to have to do this the hard way.Lynn: I believe there‚Äôs been a misunderstanding. We are basitin ambassadors on a peaceful diplomatic mission to‚Äî
Seraphina: Do I look like the kind of person who cares about politics? That said, we have nothing against you, rabbit-ears. All we want is the wolf. Hand it over and we‚Äôll be on our way.
Keith: Lynn, what am I looking at? Is that a dragon?
Lynn: No, I don‚Äôt believe so.
Lynn: Emblem of an Adrakist ‚Äî dragon worshiper. Many humans consider dragons a symbol of power. Some are‚Ä¶ more fanatical about it than others. Rest assured though, despite her bizarre appearance, she‚Äôs still human.
Seraphina: Biza‚Äî You have something to say about the way I look?!
Lynn: Oh, no, I quite like the lizard look, it‚Äôs very‚Ä¶ unusual.
Seraphina: ‚ÄúLizard‚Äù?!Sealeen: Hey, calm down, Sarah! Maybe you should let me and Landen do the talking instead? R-right, Lan?
Landen: ‚Ä¶Eh.
Sealeen: If these guys really are ambassadors, we might get in big trouble if we‚Äî

Seraphina: R R R A A A A A H H H H !!
Sealeen: And‚Ä¶ here we go again.
Landen: Mmhm.
[E AYS]
Seraphina: I may not be a full dragon yet, but I have plenty of fire for you! Now tell us where your wolf is or your friends will burn!Sealeen: Hey! Y-you Basitins should cooperate! My name is Sealeen. I‚Äôm a Templar, and my friend here is a guard. If you fight back, we‚Äôll be forced to arrest you! R-right, Landy?
Landen: ‚Ä¶Sure.
Madelyn: A guard, huh? That‚Äôs funny‚Ä¶
Sealeen: Huh?
Madelyn: Because I had a look through your stuff, and this doesn‚Äôt seem like the gear the other guards use.
Madelyn: And are you sure you‚Äôre a Templar? Because your spellbook / journal here says otherwise.
Sealeen: What the‚Äî?! How did you‚Äî? H-hey, those are ours! Give them back!
Landen: ‚Ä¶
Keith: Wait‚Ä¶ so a fake Templar‚Ä¶
Keith: A fake guard‚Ä¶
Keith: And a fake dragon? Your entire group is nothing but a bunch of frauds!
Seraphina: Stop calling me fake!!Keith: Erg! So much for diplomacy‚Ä¶
Lynn: Sir, look out!
Keith: Gah!
Keiren: What the hell?! Looks like introductions will have to wait.
Keiren: Flora, stay here with your friend.
Keiren: You two, come with me. Daniels, go get our ace ready. I‚Äôm not taking any chances. Not today.
Soldier 1: Sir!
Soldier 2: Sir!
Flora: I wonder what happened? I hope he‚Äôll be okay.
Trace: Weren‚Äôt you just mad at him?
Flora: Well, sure, he‚Äôs a jerk. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I want him getting killed. Still, we can‚Äôt wait here. I need to catch up to those other tigers. Let‚Äôs go.Kat: Hey, Natani. I know it took me a while, but I finally finished the new version of the cloak to go with your vest. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ sure once you wake up, you‚Äôll like it. I added plenty of secret pockets, and an inlay for crystals‚Ä¶ Heh, and since it‚Äôs made of wyrm silk, it won‚Äôt catch fire this time_! Haha‚Ä¶_
Kat: It‚Äôll be okay. Keith will come through, you‚Äôll see. You have a lot of friends who care about you.
Kat: Myself included. I know we only had that one ‚Äúgirl talk‚Äù but‚Ä¶ confiding with you really meant a lot to me.
Kat: I know you and Keith have a‚Ä¶ thing going on.
Kat: But I want you to know I‚Äôm here for you as well. And‚Ä¶ if things ever change, m-maybe‚Ä¶ I mean‚Ä¶ If you were ever interested, I‚Ä¶ I might‚Ä¶
Natani: Keith‚Ä¶
Kat: GASP!
Kat: N-Natani?
Kat: Did‚Ä¶ did you say something?
Kat: Ow ow ow ow! Is this about what I said?! I wasn‚Äôt trying to get between you and Keith, I swear!
Natani: ZZZSealeen: Come on, Landy! We‚Äôve gotta back up Seraphina!
Landen: Eh‚Ä¶ that girl took my sword. Think I‚Äôll just sit this one out and finish my‚Äî

Landen: ‚Ä¶
Madelyn: Eep!
Madelyn: Wow‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre awful fast for someone without coffee‚ÄîSeraphina: Why.. Are you.. Rabbit-things.. So‚Ä¶ hard to burn!?
Lynn: Keith!
Sealeen: Not so fast!
Sealeen: I may not have my spellbook, but I‚Äôm not helpless! And unlike the others, I know a lot about basitins‚Ä¶
Sealeen: Including their weaknesses!
Lynn: ‚Ä¶ If you are attempting to poison me, you probably should have done a little more research.
Sealeen: Oh, it‚Äôs not poison‚Ä¶ Say‚Ä¶
Sealeen: You‚Äôre pretty cute. Are you sure you still wanna fight me? If you just help me find that wolf, I‚Äôd be very‚Ä¶ grateful.[Twokinds]
[12]
Flora: 12 years and still going strong!Sealeen: ‚Ä¶
Sealeen: Eh‚Ä¶ w-well? Is‚Ä¶ is it working? Your face‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt tell.
Sealeen: Eep!
Sealeen: H-hey, hold on! What are you doing? N-not so close!
Sealeen: O-oh my‚Äî!
Sealeen: Wait, wait! You‚Äôre cute and all, but you‚Äôre not really my type‚Ä¶ or species! I mean, not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with basitins, but‚Ä¶
Sealeen: O-oh dear! This isn‚Äôt what I had in mind! The potion must be too strong! H-help!
Lynn: Er‚Ä¶ Actually, I don‚Äôt think your potion had any effect. I just needed to be close to get a good sense of you. I can‚Äôt see very well.
Sealeen: W-what?!Sealeen: ‚ÄúNo effect‚Äù?
Sealeen: B-but that‚Äôs impossible! How? Those pheromones should work on any man ‚Äî keidran or basitin!
Lynn: On anyone else, it probably would have.
Lynn: I‚Äôm.. afraid you just picked the wrong basitin. You see, I am Messenger Lynn. Where I am from‚Ä¶ Society is divided by gender. But there‚Äôs.. always need of a go-between. Even during curfew.
Lynn: This requires a particular kind of person. Someone who can be blind to both. In other words‚Ä¶
Lynn: Let‚Äôs just say‚Ä¶ my ears don‚Äôt hang limp like this for no reason. Still‚Ä¶ thank you for what you said. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ not used to being flirted with. No one on the island would bother with someone like me. Even if you didn‚Äôt really mean it, it felt‚Ä¶ nice.
Sealeen: Well, I mean‚Ä¶ Okay, I admit, I was just playing you before. But, you know‚Ä¶ Those ears of yours really are kinda cute‚Ä¶
Seraphina: Are‚Ä¶ are those two seriously having a conversation right now_?!_Madelyn: Hey, so‚Ä¶ Not that I don‚Äôt enjoy dodging you forever, but‚Ä¶
Madelyn: You‚Äôre some kind of mercenary, right? Finding wolves for a bounty? How much do you get for that?
Landen: ‚Ä¶
Madelyn: Must be a lot for all this trouble. But guessing by how desperate your friend is‚Ä¶ You haven‚Äôt had much luck, right?
Madelyn: You don‚Äôt seem invested in this.
Madelyn: How about I just hire you instead? I‚Äôll pay you to not hunt wolves, and you can buy all the coffee you want without doing a thing!
Madelyn: What do you say?
[I H‚ô•TE THURSD]
Landen: ‚ÄúAll the coffee I want‚Äù‚Ä¶
[ALSO TUESDAY]
Landen: Welp. I‚Äôm out. Later, girls.
Sealeen: Landy?
Seraphina: Wait, what?! Landen! Get back here, you lazy traitor! What is wrong with the two of you! Why won‚Äôt you fight?!
Seraphina: Grrahh! Enough! I‚Äôve had it! I‚Äôm a dragon! You should all be treating me with the respect I deserve!Keiren: We can‚Äôt wait for the ace to arrive. We have to protect any civilians. Prepare for anything.
Seraphina: I‚Äôll show you all why dragons are feared!
Keiren: Stop right there, villainous fiend! Nobody breaks the law on my shift! Now put down your‚Äî
Keiren: ‚Ä¶ Fire.
Soldier: Look out, sir!
Seraphina: I‚Äôll burn you to ash!
Madelyn: Well, I suppose if you‚Äôre not holding back anymore, then neither will I.
Lynn: Agreed.
Keith: Time to extinguish this ‚Äúdragon‚Äù once and for all.Seraphina: Hah! I‚Äôd like to see you try!
Keith: Argh!
Keith: Damn. We just need an opening! Something to distract her, like‚Äî
Keiren: Hey! I said stop, you monster, in the name of the guard!
Seraphina: Ow! The hell‚Äî?!Seraphina: Who threw that?!
Seraphina: Someone threw something at me! Show yourself!
Keith: Now! Lynn!
Lynn: Yes, My Lord!Madelyn: Hey dragon lady! I‚Äôve got something to throw at you!
Madelyn: Catch!
Seraphina: Huh?
Keith: RAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Seraphina: AAAAAAAAH!!Keiren: I want these fires put out!
Keiren: Reed! You, Travel, and anyone who knows basic water magic, get on it!
Alice: Yes, sir!
Keiren: And you!
Keiren: I need answers! What‚Äôs going on?
Lynn: I believe I can help with that one.
Lynn: You see, we are a basitin envoy here on a diplomatic mission. It seems we ran into a bit of a‚Ä¶ miscommunication with your people.
Sealeen: Hey, wait! Wasn‚Äôt that burned?
Lynn: Oh please, my dear. I‚Äôm a bureaucrat. All my documents are in triplicate, naturally.Keiren: Basitin diplomats?
Lynn: Yes. It‚Äôd be unfortunate if your city was found to be responsible for a‚Ä¶ Diplomatic incident between our nations.
Keiren: ‚ÄúD‚Ä¶ diplomatic incident‚Äù?
Lynn: After all‚Ä¶ We basitins are still allies of your kind, correct? Or is this Edinmire‚Äôs way of declaring war‚Äî
Keiren: W-wait! Now hold on just a minute!
Keiren: I‚Äôm sure this is all just some kind of misunderstanding! E-Edinmire of course welcomes our‚Ä¶ esteemed island friends. We were simply not aware that the basitin king was sending an envoy!
Keiren: I can assure you, this Adrakist was not acting on Edinmire‚Äôs behalf. We will hold her until this can all be sorted out.
Seraphina: Ngaaah!!! What?! Me?
Keith: How can she still get up after that?!
Lynn: It appears her hide is as tough as her scales.
Madelyn: (thoughts) Huh. So that‚Äôs what a human‚Äôs looks like. Neat.
Seraphina: They‚Äôre the ones who should be arrested! They‚Äôre hiding a wolf!Daniels: Sir, sir! The Ace‚Äî
Keiren: That‚Äôs irrelevant, Adrakist!
Keiren: You‚Äôve damaged city property and endangered innocent lives. I‚Äôm taking you into custody. Surrender peacefully, lizard!
Seraphina: L-L-Lizard?!
Seraphina: I am Seraphina! Adrakist of Fire! I don‚Äôt answer to you, or anyone else in this hick town! You should be listening to me! You should all be looking upon me with the reverence deserving of a goddess!
Seraphina: Because I!

Seraphina: Am!
Seraphina: A!

Seraphina: Dra‚Ä¶gon?Keiren: A dragon, hm? Well, Sarah, meet our own dragon:

Seraphina: goshohmygoshohmy mygoshohmygoshohm mygoshohmygoshohm shohmygoshohmSeraphina: A dragon‚Ä¶ right in front of me! And not just any dragon‚Ä¶ The royal dragon! I‚Äôd heard you‚Äôd gone missing from the capital, but I had no idea you were here!
Seraphina: Princess, this is such an honor. You‚Äôre an inspiration!
Reni: (thoughts) Oh‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ t-thank you. But I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôve caused quite a lot of trouble.
Reni: (thoughts) I need you to come with me for now.
Seraphina: Princess Reni‚Ä¶ used her magic on me!
Seraphina: I‚Äôm being arrested‚Ä¶ by the princess! This is the best‚Ä¶ day‚Ä¶ ev‚Äî
Keiren: ‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ this is not how I pictured my day going. Would someone please lend her their cloak?
Soldier: Yes, sir!
Keiren: Er‚Ä¶ thank you for the assistance, miss‚Ä¶ your highness. S-sorry to bring you out for something so trivial. I figured better safe than sorry.
Reni: (thoughts) Please, just Reni is fine. I‚Äôm not really nobility. And it‚Äôs no trouble. I‚Äôm only glad I could settle this peacefully. The captain is kinda cute.
Reni: (thoughts) Well I‚Äôd better get back before the tiger meeting starts! Goodbye!Keiren: O‚Ä¶kay. Just going to suppress that.
Keiren: Ahem! As for you three‚Ä¶ Tell me: is what she said true? Do you have a wolf?
Keiren: Hey, relax. Look, as far as I‚Äôm concerned, you‚Äôve got diplomatic immunity.
Keiren: Just keep it out of the public eye, alright? Lotta folk on edge right now. Otherwise, welcome to Edinmire.
Keiren: Now if you‚Äôll excuse me‚Ä¶
Daniels: Captain.
Keiren: Hm? Oh, Daniels. Good work getting to the Ace in time.
Daniels: Thank you, sir. On the way back, though, I was stopped by a farmer ‚Äî Ol‚Äô Rinehold. He claims he saw figures moving through his fields on the outskirts near Riftwall‚Ä¶ again. He says it‚Äôs wolves this time.
Keiren: Sigh‚Ä¶ Fifth time this week. Of course he‚Äôd pick today too. It‚Äôs probably just kids cutting through his fields again.
Daniels: Should I check it out, sir?
Keiren: No, Reed can. I have something else for you.
Keiren: I need you to go to the docks. Find out what ship the basitins arrived on.. discreetly.
Daniels: Sir?
Keiren: I want to know where this wolf of theirs is.Flora: Here we are. Shepherd‚Äôs Square.
Flora: It‚Äôs so strange, seeing tigers interacting with humans like this. Unlike wolves, tigers have always been isolationists.
Flora: Wait here. I‚Äôm going to find out what‚Äôs going on.
Trace: Flora, are you sure that‚Äôs a good idea?
Flora: It‚Äôs fine, Trace. These are my people.
[RIFT]
Iris: (in Keidran) How bizarre, these humans. I‚Äôve never seen them so close before. They really don‚Äôt have tails?
Tigress: (in Keidran) One of my cousins swears they do! But they always wear clothes so you can‚Äôt tell. We have a bet that she can get a guard out of his armor before the first night.
Iris: (in Keidran) Well, good luck to her. Humans are as prudish as they are repulsive.
Flora: (in Keidran) Erm‚Ä¶ excuse me!
Iris: Hm?Flora: Sorry, but if you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what is one of the tribes doing in human territory? I mean, I know you were invited, but why agree? Aren‚Äôt you afraid the Templar might try something? Why trust‚Äî
Iris: Snrk‚Ä¶ What is that accent?
Flora: Wha-? Accent? I don‚Äôt have an‚Äî
Tigress: Yeah, I hear it too! She sounds‚Ä¶ off. Just a bit‚Ä¶ human-ish.
Iris: Oh, I see. You‚Äôre a domesticated keidran.
Flora: What? No! I‚Äôm a natural-born tiger! I‚Äôm not a slave! N-not anymore‚Ä¶
Iris: Hun, your scent reeks of human. Clearly you‚Äôre still someone‚Äôs pet.
Flora: I‚Äôm not a pet!!
Tigress: Don‚Äôt be mean, Iris!
Iris: No offense! I think it‚Äôs adorable you still feel like part of the tribe. Hold on to that, sweetie. But I‚Äôm afraid we don‚Äôt have time to humor you. Your masters have important business with us real tigers right now.
Iris: Ta-ta!Flora: Maeve?
Flora: What are you doing here?
Flora: Did you follow us all the way from the tavern?
Maeve: Mmhm.
Flora: And does your mom know you‚Äôre out here?
Maeve: ‚Ä¶
Flora: Well, I guess I can‚Äôt blame you too much. I used to sneak off all the time when I was your age.
Flora: Though it was usually to the woods, not town square.
Flora: Still, we should probably get you back to your momma.
Maeve: Miss Flora?
Flora: Hm?
Maeve: Sometimes people say I sound human too.
Flora: Well‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you different.Trace: Flora, how did it go? Did they tell you why they‚Äî ‚Ä¶Uh‚Ä¶
Trace: Hello.
Flora: Yeah, turns out they weren‚Äôt very helpful. But I ran into someone else along the way!
Maeve: Hi.
Flora: Seems she tried to tag along ‚Äî without momma cat knowing.
Trace: Oh. Well, should we head back to the tavern, then?
Flora: I think we‚Äôre better off if we stay put for now.
Flora: I have a feeling Adira will come looking, and I don‚Äôt want us to accidentally pass each other. All roads tend to lead here, so it‚Äôs the best place to wait.
Madelyn: Hey! Looks like you‚Äôre right, Flora. We all ended up in the same place!
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Madelyn: Say, who‚Äôs the kid?
Flora: Oh, this is just a friend we ran into along the way. Uh‚Ä¶ who are those two?
Landen: Sup?
Madelyn: Same!
Trace: ‚Ä¶Trace: Er‚Ä¶ hi, Keith. How‚Äôs it going with‚Ä¶ you-know-what?
Keith: Ehm‚Ä¶ nothing yet.
Sealeen: What‚Äôs up with them? Do those two not like each other or something?
Madelyn: No, not at all. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ complicated. I really shouldn‚Äôt say, but you see‚Ä¶
Madelyn: They were once lovers.
Sealeen: Whaaaaa~?! Oh my goodness! But they‚Äôre both‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre different‚Ä¶
Sealeen: T-that‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ scandalous!
Sealeen: Is that really true?!
Madelyn: Okay‚Ä¶ maybe not. It‚Äôs just a lot less dumb than the real reason‚Ä¶
Madelyn: ‚Ä¶that one did something stupid, and is now too stubborn to just apologize. Sigh‚Ä¶ boys.Master Seer: Ladies and gentlemen! Humans and felines! Welcome!
Flora: Well, looks like whatever‚Äôs going on, it‚Äôs starting.
Madelyn: Wow! Look at all the Floras! Floras everywhere!
Flora: Oh my gosh, Maddie! That‚Äôs almost exactly what I said about basitins and Keiths!
Flora: You‚Äôre hilarious!
Madelyn: Hee hee hee!
Madelyn: Hee‚Ä¶ heh‚Ä¶Flora: Uh‚Ä¶
Flora: Maddie? Something the matter?
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Master Seer: Good afternoon. If I may have everyone‚Äôs attention. I am Seer Brahn. I want to thank you, noble tigers, for accepting our humble invitation.
Master Seer: And thank you, good folk of Edinmire, for welcoming them. I know our relationship with the beast folk has been strained, now more than ever. But it‚Äôs important to remember that tigers are not wolves.
Master Seer: And keidran, like all people, are not made equal. So, welcome, friends.
Keith: Great. The Templar. Anyone else getting a strange feeling of d√©j√† vu?Flora: I have a bad feeling about this. Which Templar is that?
Trace: ‚ÄòEy!
Sealeen: I know! That there is Brahn, the Master Seer - one of the Grand Templar‚Äôs five lieutenants.
Sealeen: I‚Äôve never seen one in person before. All five Masters are said to possess a unique magical gift, and his is supposedly precognition. I don‚Äôt know if I buy that, though. Predicting the future has always been a fickle thing.
Sealeen: There are rumors that he‚Äôs just a front, and that his true power comes from his daughter. I‚Äôve heard that, despite being blind, she can see through the eyes of any animal she‚Äôs come into contact with.
Sealeen: You‚Äôd never know when you‚Äôre being watched.
Flora: Scary thought.Keiren: Ah, there you are, Flora! Looks like I made it.
Flora: Oh, hello‚Ä¶ again, Keiren. Everything alright back there?
Keiren: Oh, sure, just a minor scuffle. Not a problem for the guard!
Keiren: Still, you wouldn‚Äôt believe it. The whole incident was sparked by a couple of those island weirdos, the‚Ä¶
Keith: ‚Ä¶
Keiren: I - I mean our time-honored Basitin allies!
Keiren: Flora, you know that guy?
Flora: Huh? You mean Keith? Yeah, we‚Äôre friends. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ another long story.
Keiren: Oh. Well, you know, the friends of my friend‚Ä¶
Flora: I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd call us friends, Kei‚Ä¶
Keiren: Er‚Ä¶
Keiren: Well, seems like you‚Äôve had quite the adventure since leaving the farm‚Ä¶ Hopefully I‚Äôll get to hear all these ‚Äúlong stories‚Äù one day.Tiger 1: Your words are like honey. You speak of friendship. But for many of my kind, the only humans they know are the ones who steal our families away in the night.
Tiger 1: I ask, why now should we listen to your words?
Master Seer: I had a feeling you‚Äôd say that. And you‚Äôre right. This will require more than mere words. It needs a show of faith.
Master Seer: Which is why I‚Äôve decided‚Ä¶ The practice of hunting and trading feline keidran will be abolished.
Tigress: Grrk!
Flora: (in Human) Wait, what?!
Trace: (in Human) What?
Tiger 2: Can he do that?
Tiger 3: Woah‚Ä¶
Keiren: (in Human) Wow. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ certainly going to cause quite an upset if he‚Äôs serious. I‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre not ecstatic, though. This is great news, right?
Flora: (thoughts) Could he really be sincere?
Master Seer: Now, this will not be an easy change. It will require time. But I believe it‚Äôs time the Templar turn over a new leaf.Daniels: Alarm! Alarm! We‚Äôre under attack!
Keiren: Daniels?!
Keiren: Daniels, what is it? What‚Äôs going on?
Daniels: Ngh‚Äî Couldn‚Äôt reach the docks‚Ä¶ magic circles in the fields‚Ä¶ Whole city is surrounded.
Keiren: By what? Wolves?!
Daniels: They were cloaked, I couldn‚Äôt tell for sure. But their emblems‚Ä¶
Daniels: They were dressed like Templar.
Master Seer: What?
Tiger 1: Brahn‚Ä¶
Tiger 1: What is the meaning of this?!Master Seer: I swear, whatever this is, it is not our doing!
Tiger 1: (in Keidran) Pray you speak the truth, human.
Tiger 1: (in Keidran) ‚Ä¶For we tigers here are but a fraction of those waiting at your borders. If we should not return, it will mean war.
Keiren: Why would the Templar do this? Something doesn‚Äôt add up here. Daniels, how soon until they get here?
Daniels: I don‚Äôt actually think they were coming this way, sir. I can‚Äôt say for certain, but it looked like they were cutting off routes out of the city. I saw them burning a line of fire through the fields, heading down towards‚Äî
Keith: ‚ÄîThe docks!
Keith: Natani!
Madelyn: Keith, wait!
Lynn: Let‚Äôs move.
Daniels: Sir, what should we do? Don‚Äôt the Templar technically outrank‚Ä¶ ngh‚Ä¶ us?
Keiren: I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs the Grand Templar himself! Assemble the guard.
Daniels: Y-yes sir!Kat: Hm‚Ä¶ You know, I‚Äôve always found magic fascinating.
Kat: Of course, as a slave, I was never allowed to try.  But I‚Äôd sometimes sneak school books from Roderick. And now that I‚Äôm free‚Ä¶ maybe I could learn some day?
Kat: Mreowf!
Kat: I didn‚Äôt mean right now! W-what the heck is that?!
Kat: Wait here, Natani! I‚Äôll be right back!Voice: Natani!
Natani: Ngh‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Did I go drinking last night? I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ feel right.
Natani: What the‚Äî? That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ odd. Hello? Keith? Spots?
Natani: (thoughts) Zen? Zen, where are you?
Natani: O‚Ä¶ kay.
Natani: (thoughts) I get it. This is in my head. But then‚Ä¶ why can‚Äôt I feel Zen? He‚Äôs always in here too, even when we‚Äôre asleep. But it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ silent. And if this is my mind‚Ä¶
Natani: Why are these still here?!Natani: Oh, come on! My mind is the one place where I can feel like myself!
Natani: Why am I still a woman in here?!
Natani: Sigh‚Ä¶
Young Natani: Jeez. Get ahold of yourself, Natani.
Young Natani: Yeah. Yeah. Gotta get ahold of my‚Äî
Natani: ‚Ä¶self‚Ä¶
Natani: WAAAAH!!
Young Natani: Damn. I end up stacked when I‚Äôm older. What a pain.Narration: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Keiren: Everyone please remain calm! You‚Äôre safe inside the walls!
Trace: Flora, we should get out of here!
Flora: Look!
Masked Templar: No one is going anywhere. You Keidran were fools to come.
Masked Templar: And so too are the ones who invited you. Traitors to humanity.
Masked Templar: The Templar will never consort with beasts! And now you will all burn together, fools and traitors alike!Adira: Maeve!
Masked Templar: You will all burn in the name of Grand Templar Trace!
Trace: Gah! Don‚Äôt drag me into this!
Flora: Hey, wait! Where‚Äôs‚Äî?
Maeve: Mommy!
Adira: Maeve!Masked Templar: No one will escape our fire!
Adira: Maeve, stop! No!
Adira: Maeve!Maeve: Mom‚Äî!‚Äù
Adira: H-hrah‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace! Your arm! You didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Trace: I‚Äôm responsible for this!
Trace: It‚Äôs my fault‚Ä¶
Keith: You couldn‚Äôt help Laura! You can‚Äôt help Natani!
Keith: You were once Grand Templar. What good are you now?
Trace: Keith was right! All I ever do is let people down. I had to save someone! What good am I, if all I do is pretend I‚Äôm not here while they‚Äôre killing in my name?
Trace: I can‚Äôt keep hiding. Not if it means this!Masked Templar: Wait, who is‚Äî?
Trace: My name is Trace. Better known as the once Grand Templar Trace.
Trace: The same name you called on to justify your actions.
Tigress: (in Keidran) The grand Templar!
Trace: But these actions are not my will! So if you claim to be followers of mine, then I order you to stop! Because I really can‚Äôt afford to lose control again‚Ä¶
Masked Templar: Grand Templar Trace! Could that really be him?
Masked Templar: Is this part of the plan? What should we do?
Masked Templar: No. Grand Templar Trace is dead. This one is an imposter. He must be.
Masked Templar: And he will burn in our fire like the rest!
Trace: Crap.Trace: (thoughts) What do I do? There‚Äôs no way I can shield against that many! Not without losing control. But if I move, that amount might take out half the square!
Trace: (thoughts) I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Trace: No.
Trace: I am the Grand Templar. You will obey me!
Trace: And I said‚Ä¶ STOP!Masked Templar: It‚Ä¶ it really is him! Nobody said anything about facing the Grand Templar!
Masked Templar: I - I‚Äôm out!
Masked Templar: No! Not yet! Stand your ground!
Masked Templar: Grand Templar or not, he‚Äôs still just one‚Äî
Masked Templar: Dragon!Keiren: Alright, Reni! Show them some real fire power!
Masked Templar: We should retreat!
Masked Templar: No!
Masked Templar: Do not be fooled! It may be a dragon, but it is just a juvenile! Our magic will protect us from even a dragon‚Äôs fi‚Äî
Masked Templar: . . .
Masked Templar: We‚Äôve played our part.Trace: Phew‚Ä¶
Flora: You did it! Trace, that was amazing!
Trace: Oof!
Flora: And you didn‚Äôt lose control this time!
Flora: You‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt, right? You‚Äôre still you?
Trace: Heh, yeah. It‚Äôs still me, Flora. No shadowy voices or anything.
Flora: Dang it, Trace. You really had me worried again. I‚Äî
Flora: I, uh‚Ä¶
Flora: Um‚Ä¶
Iris: Oh my‚Ä¶
Trace: Sigh‚Ä¶ So much for trying to lay low.
Adira: Well, I for one am grateful you didn‚Äôt.Adira: Thank you, Grand Templar, for my life. To be honest, it was not something I would have expected from someone of your reputation.
Adira: Ah‚Ä¶ no offense.
Trace: None taken.
Flora: You don‚Äôt seem that surprised.
Adira: Oh, I knew who you were. But like I said back at the tavern, I know when not to pry.
Adira: I‚Äôve heard the stories about you, of course, like everyone else. But clearly they can‚Äôt all be true. I am one keidran, at least, who is grateful you‚Äôve returned.
Adira: I wish I had money to repay you. But if my tavern still stands, you‚Äôll always be welcome.
Trace: Oh, thanks! But there‚Äôs really no need to‚Äî
Adira: See you around, Mr. Trace.Trace: What‚Ä¶ was that all about?
Flora: She was just showing gratitude. In our way. She‚Äôs a keidran.
Trace: Oh! Alright. Heh. For a second there, I thought she was‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ propositioning me.
Flora: Well, like I said, she‚Äôs a keidran.
Keiren: (thoughts) I can‚Äôt believe it‚Ä¶ That run who was with Flora‚Ä¶ was the Grand Templar?!
Keiren: (thoughts) I only ever saw him the once, before he became a recluse. And Flora‚Äôs just casually talking with him! She even hugged him! Doesn‚Äôt that girl realize who he is?
Keiren: (thoughts) Wait a minute‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs Trace. The same Trace who owns the Legacy Estate. His estate is here because he also held the title of Duke of Edinmire.
Keiren: (thoughts) A position he still holds. And that means he‚Äôs technically my boss.
Keiren: A boss I tried to have arrested earlier today!
Daniels: Sir!
Daniels: You need to see this! It‚Äôs the Templar Miss Reni took out.
Keiren: What is it now?Soldier: Is that‚Äî?!
Kei: It‚Äôs a wolf!
Keiren: I knew it! I knew there was something more to this! Those rotten fleabags!
Keiren: I knew the Templar wouldn‚Äôt do this! This was a setup from the start! Dressing up as Templar and attacking the tigers while framing us in the process! Bastards!
Keiren: We need to move! There‚Äôs still at least two, probably more‚Äî huh?
Tallon: Captain!
Tallon: Warden Tallon, reporting! We‚Äôre the reenforcements you sent for!
Keiren: I sent for? Wait, from‚Ä¶?
Tallon: The Wolfpens. The relief units you sent said you needed every able-bodied soldier here. We were told you‚Äôd been overrun!
Keiren: Wha‚Äî? Relief units‚Äî? What are you talking about? I never sent any relief units to‚Ä¶
Keiren: ‚Ä¶The Wolfpens!Keiren: All the wolves rounded up in the southeast are being held in The Wolfpens! If they break them out‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre going to have a war on our hands!
Alice: That‚Äôs not the worst of it, Captain!
Keiren: Who are you?! Are you one of them? Show your face!
Alice: Captain, get ahold of yourself! It‚Äôs Lt. Reed!
Alice: Fires are still spreading toward the harbour. We have to do something, or Edinmire will be left crippled.
Trace: We can answer questions later. Let‚Äôs get out of here while he‚Äôs distracted.
Flora: Right!
Alice: Fires have also started up all over the city! So what do we do? Do we go after the wolves? The docks? The city?
Keiren: I‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶
Alice: Captain! What should we do?
Tiger 1: We will fight.
Keiren: Er, you? But‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre‚Ä¶
Tiger 1: We may be keidran, but we are tigers first. I hold no love for humans, but I will defend my people.
Master Seer: As will I. The Templar cannot allow these filthy imposters to soil our good name.Natani: What the hell is going on?
Natani: How is there a younger version of me in my own head? Who are you? Are you the reason I‚Äôm stuck like this?
Young Natani: If you mean stuck in your head, then no. I‚Äôm pretty sure having Zen‚Äôs mental crutch swept out from under us did that. If you mean stuck looking like your normal bosomy self‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because of how you feel right now.
Natani: I do not feel like a woman!
Young Natani: No, but without Zen we‚Äôre feeling pretty weak. And you consider woman and weakness in the same breath. Sooo, your mind just falls back on what it knows‚Ä¶
Young Natani: ‚Ä¶And bam! You‚Äôre stuck with your‚Ä¶ bountiful womanliness.Young Natani: Here, give me your hand‚Äî
Natani: Keep away from me!
Natani: I don‚Äôt need to be mocked by my own imagination. And I‚Äôm not buying it. Zen is here somewhere, I know it. I just have to find him and wake up!
Young Natani: Hey, wait!
Young Natani: Come back!
Natani: Zen? Zen?!
Natani: Zen!Natani: I knew it! I knew you still had to be here! Hey, Ze‚Äî!
Natani: Yeow!
Natani: That hurt!
Natani: Oh, wait‚Ä¶ no it didn‚Äôt. None of this is real.
Natani: But what the hell is this?!
Natani: Zen!
Young Natani: You know, I love Zen too, but it‚Äôs kinda weird to want him inside our head so badly. Like I said, we‚Äôre cut off.
Young Natani: But maybe I‚Ä¶ can help? Hint, hint.Natani: Don‚Äôt you ‚Äúhint hint‚Äù me! I‚Äôm not an idiot, okay? I know what you are, I see where this is all going. But I won‚Äôt play along! I refuse! I refuse to let myself‚Ä¶
Natani: To let myself be you again.
Young Natani: Natani‚Ä¶
Young Natani: Look‚Ä¶ I get it. You see accepting me as losing yourself.
Young Natani: That somehow this is going to end with you in a dress embracing all things girly or something. You think of your younger self as the scared little girl Zen‚Äôs link saved you from being.
Young Natani: But none of that is true. You remember yourself that way, because it‚Äôs how Zen remembered you.
Natani: Don‚Äôt blame Zen! He didn‚Äôt see me as weak.
Young Natani: He saw us the only way he could‚Ä¶
Young Natani: ‚Ä¶As a big brother protecting the only family he had left.
Young Natani: A part of him will always think of us as his helpless baby sister. And the link burned that into your mind.Natani: Are you saying that I remember myself wrong?
Young Natani: Probably more than you realize. A lot of blanks had to be filled in after our mind was shattered.
Young Natani: I know you blame me for all the feelings you associate with being a woman.
Young Natani: But truthfully, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre as different as you believe.
Natani: What do you mean?
Young Natani: Natani, I didn‚Äôt cut my hair and dress like a boy just to join Zen in the guild.
Young Natani: Secretly‚Ä¶ I liked it. I mean, I didn‚Äôt mind being a girl, but‚Ä¶ I liked being seen as a boy.
Natani: What? I disguised myself because I was desperate! I had to!
Young Natani: No, that‚Äôs just how Zen saw it! I never told him.
Young Natani: Don‚Äôt you see? You‚Äôre always giving Zen so much credit for making you who you are now. But the way you see yourself‚Ä¶ the feelings you have, both masculine and, yes, occasionally feminine‚Ä¶
Young Natani: ‚Ä¶It all comes from you.Natani: I‚Ä¶
Natani: I always assumed it was all Zen. That being myself might have me go back to‚Ä¶ you know.
Young Natani: Yes. And I think that fear is what‚Äôs kept you trapped here. You don‚Äôt need Zen to make you who you are.
Young Natani: That‚Äôs not to say what you experienced with Zen was not real. The link will always be a part of us. And the damage to our mind, likewise, will never be completely healed. But the choices you made and how you chose to act on it‚Ä¶ that was you.
Young Natani: I just hoped to remind you of that. Where you came from, and‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶how to stand up on your own again.
Natani: I‚Ä¶ I get it. I‚Äôm still not sure how I feel about you. But‚Ä¶ you are a part of me. And you‚Äôre right. I need to start relying on myself.
Young Natani: I‚Äôm glad. Because this is the way it should be.
Young Natani: ‚Ä¶and because if we don‚Äôt, I suspect we‚Äôll end up burning to death pretty soon.
Natani: (thoughts) Wait, what?Natani: (thoughts) Okay, I need to get up to speed. Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ No Zen. No Keith. No‚Ä¶ clothes. Kathrin?
Natani: (in Keidran) Hey, what‚Äôs going on, Kat?
Kat: N-Natani?
Natani: (in Keidran) Yeah, I‚Äôm still me‚Ä¶ I think. How long was I out for? And what‚Äôs with all the smoke? You burn a cake or someth‚Äî
Kat: NATANI! ‚Äîcan‚Äôt believe it! You‚Äî ‚Äîso worried! You just fell‚Äî ‚ÄîKeith and I tried to look after you‚Äî ‚Äîfinally reached the land and th‚Äî ‚Äîthere was an explosion and smoke‚Äî ‚Äîdocks and I couldn‚Äôt find Mike or Evals‚Äî ‚Äîeveryone else was already on shore‚Äî ‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt just leave you here so tr‚Äî ‚Äîdrag you but you were too heavy‚Äî ‚Äîdidn‚Äôt know what else to do!‚Äî ‚Äîyou were going to die!‚Äî ‚Äîglad you‚Äôre okay!‚Äî
Natani: (thoughts) O‚Ä¶kay. Pretty sure even if I knew Human, I wouldn‚Äôt have got that. Also personal spaceKat: I wish Keith was here. He went ashore to find help for you!
Natani: Ashore?! How long was I out?
Kat: Ages! How do you feel? Are you in pain?
Natani: Actually, I feel‚Ä¶ surprisingly okay. Maybe a little weak, but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like a fog‚Äôs been lifted. One I didn‚Äôt know was there.
Kat: I‚Äôm so relieved! Keith and I took turns, every day, caring for you. And I tried to do everything I could to keep you healthy.
Natani: And I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ really grateful! But‚Ä¶ could you please get off me now? I‚Äôm feeling pretty exposed at the moment.
Kat: O-oh! Right, sorry! Let me help you up!
Kat: Don‚Äôt worry, though! Everyone else left‚Äî -the ship!
Kat: Oh no! I forgot! We need to go, right now! There‚Äôs smoke and fire coming from the docks! I don‚Äôt know where it came from but I think the ship could be next!
Natani: Ow.
Natani: (thoughts) Sigh‚Ä¶ Yep, there‚Äôs the pain.Natani: Wait!
Kat: Huh?
Natani: Are these the new robes you were making for me?
Kat: Well, yes, I finished them and your smallclothes while you were out. But this is no time to be dressing!
Natani: I‚Äôm not going to leave them behind! You said this stuff was fireproof, right?
Natani: Here, hang on to this! I‚Äôll be right back!
Kat: Wha?!
Kat: Natani! Where are you going?! The stairs are this way!
Natani: Cough! Cough!
Natani: Come on, where is‚Ä¶?
Natani: Ah-hah!
Natani: Keith would never forgive himself if he lost this. And I think we can both agree, he‚Äôs been through enough.Kat: Uh‚Ä¶ oh‚Ä¶
Natani: Look out!
Kat: Natani, you‚Ä¶ saved me.
Natani: Don‚Äôt thank me yet. Looks like you were right ‚Äî the ship‚Äôs going down.
Natani: Come on, let‚Äôs go!
Kat: But‚Ä¶ that was the way to the stairs! How do we get out now?!
Kat: Oh. Right, of course. This is‚Ä¶ probably a bad time to mention I‚Äôm not a very strong swimmer.
Natani: We‚Äôll be fine. Just hang on to me, okay?
Kat: O-okay‚Ä¶Eric: The fire‚Äôs already spread to the ships! Hurry!
Evals: Hack! Cough!
Eric: Mike, Evals! There you two are! What happened?!
Evals: Ah, I see Eric‚Äôs fine. Great.
Mike: Master! I don‚Äôt know, it happened so fast. We tried to save what we could, but there was barely time to get out!
Eric: Wha‚Äî? I don‚Äôt care about the damn paintings!
Eric: Where‚Äôs Kathrin?
Mike: Kat? I‚Ä¶ I thought she was taking the wolf ashore with the Basitins to find help?
Keith: Natani!
Evals: Speaking of Basitins‚Ä¶Keith: They‚Äôre still on the ship! We‚Äôve got to get them out!
Madelyn: Keith, no!
Keith: Get‚Ä¶ off me!
Madelyn: The docks are already falling apart! You won‚Äôt make it!
Keith: No! No, I can still get to them! It‚Äôs right there! Let me go!
[BASITIN RUM]
Keith: Please! I‚Äôm so close! I can save her! I can save‚Äî!Keith: Natani‚Ä¶
Keith: (thoughts) I‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt save him‚Ä¶
Keith: (thoughts) I couldn‚Äôt stop it from happening again. Just like Alaric‚Ä¶ and Laura. No matter how hard I try to stop it, everyone I get close to ends up the same way‚Ä¶
Keith: Natani‚Ä¶ I never told him‚Äî
Natani: Wow, glad no one else was on that thing. Urgh‚Ä¶ I think I underestimated just how hard swimming for two would be‚Ä¶ especially given the circumstances. Haa‚Ä¶ You okay there, Kat?
Kat: I think I swallowed a fish‚Ä¶
Natani: Hah, lucky. I‚Äôm starving.
Keith: N‚Ä¶ Natani‚Ä¶?
Natani: Oh, hey Keith. Huff‚Ä¶ Sorry to keep you waiting. What did I miss?
Kat: (in Human) Keith? Where?Kathrin: Eric!
Eric: Erg! Kathrin, you‚Äôre okay!
Keith: Natani‚Ä¶ You‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) What‚Äôs the matter, Keith? Aren‚Äôt you happy to see me?
BAP! BLEP
Natani: (in Keidran) Gah! The face! Why always the face?!
Natani: Eh?
Keith: (in Keidran) I thought you were dead. I didn‚Äôt know how to help you. And then‚Ä¶ you just get back up on your
own, just like that‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) Well, to be fair, coming back was a little more involved than ‚Äújust that.‚Äù
Natani: (in Keidran) But, you know me. I‚Äôm not one to play the damsel in distress. I missed you too, Keith.
Keith: (in Keidran) Uh, speaking of damsel, I just realized my face was‚Ä¶ your chest isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) Oh‚Ä¶ yeah. There‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt a lot of time. And living seemed more urgent than getting dressed.
Sigh‚Ä¶ I guess the jig is up.Keith: (in Keidran) We can still try going with the old‚Ä¶ Basitin you-know-what?
Natani: (in Keidran) The other Basitins won‚Äôt buy that. Sigh‚Ä¶ forget it.
Natani: (in Keidran) Look‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs‚Ä¶ no such thing as ‚ÄúBasitin black magic.‚Äù Keith made that up to cover for me.
I‚Äôve always preferred to be seen as a guy. How I look is‚Ä¶ just how I‚Äôve always been, okay?
Natani: (in Keidran) B-but this really isn‚Äôt the time! I may be out of the loop, but clearly there‚Äôs more important
stuff going on right now than my bosom. So, I‚Äôd appreciate it if we could just‚Ä¶ not make a big deal about it.
Eric: (in Keidran) Miss Natani! You saved Kathrin‚Äôs life! I am in your debt. If there‚Äôs ever any way I can repay you‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) You can start by not calling me ‚Äúmiss‚Äù again. And don‚Äôt. Even. Think about asking me to pose
for one of those paintings.
Eric: (in Keidran) O-of course! I‚Ä¶ would never consider it!
Mike: What?! No Basitin black magic?! That‚Äôs impossible! I didn‚Äôt just spontaneously turn into a girl
one day for no reason!
Evals: What if‚Ä¶ he spent so long as a girl, he‚Äôs started believing he always was one? That poor sexy
bastard.Keith: (in Keidran) Wow, Natani. You‚Äôre handling this all‚Ä¶ surprisingly well. Are you‚Ä¶ sure you‚Äôre alright?
You seem a little‚Ä¶ different.
Natani: (in Keidran) D-different bad?
Keith: (in Keidran) No, no! Just‚Ä¶ unexpected.
Natani: (in Keidran) Hey, don‚Äôt get me wrong! I‚Äôm not exactly happy about this. but‚Ä¶ I gotta admit, it‚Äôs better
that it happened now than before, what with‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôll tell you later. For now, where are we? I
must have been out for a while. What‚Äôs with the dock? And the fire, and‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) ‚Ä¶and this!
Natani: (in Keidran) What is this? You look like a goat! Trying to make yourself a little less girly, huh?
Keith: (in Keidran) Hey, give me a break! I just spent the last week thinking I‚Äôd lost you. I was little more concerned
about that than I was about personal grooming, idiot!
Natani: (in Keidran) Pfff, you sap.
Smack! Thwap!
Natani: (in Keidran) T-that‚Ä¶ was just for making you worry. I‚Äôm sorry I put you through that.
Natani: (in Keidran) Looks like we‚Äôre both going to have to keep putting up with each other for a little while
longer.
Keith: (in Keidran) ‚Ä¶Yeah.
Voice: EVERYONE STAY WHERE YOU ARE!Keiren: Step away from the wolf, Basitin!
Soldier: They‚Äôve burned down half the harbour! Look! There‚Äôs another one over there!
Evals: What? Me?! I‚Äôm not a wolf! Look at the floppy ears! See? Friendly doggy!
Eric: Stop this at once! T-these Keidran are innocent! They are‚Ä¶ currently property of the Vaughan Trading Company. They are not your enemies!
Kathrin: Eric, don‚Äôt‚Äì!
Keith: Neither is the wolf. Attack him, and you attack an envoy of the Basitin Empire.
Keiren: T-the Basitin Empire? ‚Ä¶Wait, him? But‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs got‚Ä¶
Soldier: You see? Lies! Both of them! Like we‚Äôll believe some filthy non-humans and wolf sympathizers! Cut them down! Avenge Edinmire!
Soldier: GRAAAAH!!
Keiren: No! Hold!Trace: Enough!
Keiren: Who-?
Keiren: Grand Templar! Flora!
Trace: Captain, tell your men to back off. These people are my allies.
Soldier: Grand Templar?! H-how can we be sure this isn‚Äôt another wolf trick?!
Keiren: I told you to STAND DOWN!
TWANG!
Soldier: Ack!
Keiren: I will not allow any more insubordination! No one acts without my say so, understood?
Soldier: Y-yes sir!
Keiren: I apologize for my men. But you must understand, they just saw their homes attacked by wolves. With all due respect, ‚Äúallies‚Äù or not, I can‚Äôt allow canines in the open. It‚Äôll incite panic. We have to take them in!
Trace: Not going to happen!
Lynn: If‚Ä¶ I might offer a suggestion!
Lynn: I believe the Legacy Estate has a dungeon. We could‚Ä¶ ‚Äúsurrender‚Äù to you, and be taken there to appease the guards.
Lynn: (whispering) It is, after all, where you were headed anyway, is it not?
Natani: (in Keidran) So‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs going on?
Keith: (in Keidran) They want to arrest us, but it seems like Trace is going to arrest us first.
Natani: (in Keidran) Oh. Okay. ‚Ä¶ Wait, what?
Narrator: End.Epilogue
Mysterious Wolf: Brahn! I lost one of my men back there. You said we were only to be unmasked. You never said anything about facing the Grand Templar, much less a bloody dragon!
Brahn: FORMER Grand Templar. Besides, what‚Äôs one wolf to a prison full?
Brahn: From what I hear, your ‚Äúpack‚Äù is breaching the wolfpen as we speak. Nevertheless‚Ä¶ Thanks to you, the Tigers now see your kind as traitors, and Trace was forced to become involved, as I foresaw.
Mysterious Wolf: Right‚Ä¶
Mysterious Wolf: I suppose this is the point where you double-cross me, too?
Brahn: On the contrary. Let it never be said that I am not true to my word.
Brahn: The payment you requested: one flawless crystal amulet, enchanted exactly as you asked. It took a team of our best mages weeks to weave the magic.
Brahn: I hope it was worth betraying your pack mates.
Mysterious Wolf: Hmph. Says the man who allowed his own city to be attacked. Besides, I‚Äôm only half wolf.
Mysterious Wolf: And my fox half is just fine with this.Twokinds
[BEWARE OF WOLVES!]
Chapter 19 REUNIONSMaren: Sigh‚Ä¶ please tell me we‚Äôre close to this Lyn‚Äôknoll place.
Red: Nope. But I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs Barrow Rock over there. Relax, Maren. Once we reach the border city we‚Äôll be there before we know it!
Maren: Ngh‚Ä¶ Easy for you to say.
Maren: You‚Äôre not the one lugging around all the camping supplies!
Red: Hey! Keep your voice down! Soldiers sometimes patrol these roads. Need I remind you our group is currently 50% wolf!
Red: ‚ÄòSides, Sythe and I already had a turn, it‚Äôs too heavy for Karen, and Raine‚Äôs still injured. Don‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôre going to rest in‚Ä¶ three more miles!
Maren: Grrr‚Ä¶
Red: One more!
Karen: Say, Raine. I wanted to ask about your shape shifting‚Ä¶
Raine: Hm?
Karen: That cut on your stomach‚Ä¶ would it still be there if you were to turn human again?
Raine: Yes, I think any changes remain.
Karen: Oh‚Ä¶ okay.
Karen: ‚Ä¶ So say you got with Sythe and then changed back. Would you have humans or puppies?
THUD!
Maren: Karen! Don‚Äôt ask stuff like that!Sythe: Hey, speaking of my kin, our new mutual friend has barely spoken a word since we put the shackle on him. What happened to that charming rogue act?
Red: I dunno. I don‚Äôt trust it.
Karen: Woah! Hey guys, check it out!
Karen: This lake looks cool! There‚Äôs floating rocks! And the water‚Äôs steaming! Ooo‚Ä¶
Sythe: Don‚Äôt touch it, you idiot!
Karen: Huh?
Sythe: Barrow Rock might be inactive, but there‚Äôs sure to be springs around here that could still melt your skin off!
Karen: Oh‚Ä¶ Well, your little friend doesn‚Äôt seem to mind.
Sythe: My wha‚Äì
Sythe: Mrs. Nibbly! You could have been boiled alive!
Maren: As much as I hate to agree with a rodent, I‚Äôm setting my tent right here. If I‚Äôm to die, at least I‚Äôll be warm.Raine: Ow! I wish my shoes still fit. How do Keidran stand walking barefoot all the time?
Sythe: You get used to it. Aaah~! But I must admit, it‚Äôs nice to take a load off.
Maren: Ugh. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever get used to it. It‚Äôs still so strange to see you this way, with all that‚Ä¶ fur.
Raine: Sorry. I know it bothers you. But believe me, if you think that‚Äôs awkward, try being the one who has to wear the f‚Äî
BRUSH!
Raine: Eep!
Raine: Maren! W-what are you doing?
Maren: Brushing you. Your fur is tangled and matted all over. You clearly don‚Äôt know how to care for it. Don‚Äôt take this the wrong way, but I used to have a dog I groomed all the time.
Maren: Dishevelled fur is kind of a pet-peeve of mine. It‚Äôs why I try to avoid looking at Sythe.
Sythe: You know you love it!
Maren: So hold still and let me know if this hurts.
Raine: N-no‚Ä¶ This‚Ä¶ this is nice.Maren: Oh, I‚Äôm going to need this out of the way.
Raine: Wha-? Hey! Maren! Don‚Äôt do that! The guys are right over there!
Maren: Uh, Raine‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre covered in fur, remember? Nothing‚Äôs going to show.
Karen: Yeah! Besides, how are you going to get in the spring otherwise? Relax, we‚Äôre all friends here! Well, except the moody wolf over there.
Raine: I‚Ä¶ I know. Modesty‚Äôs kind of silly at this point. Especially with all the time we‚Äôve spent camping together. I‚Äôd just‚Ä¶ prefer to keep it on for now. It helps me feel a little more‚Ä¶ human.
Sythe: Hey, don‚Äôt sweat it, Raine. It‚Äôs fine. Whatever makes you comfortable.
Sythe: (whispering) Although, even with the top‚Ä¶ You know there are also rows going down her stomach under that fur, right?
PFFF!
Sythe: (whispering) On me too, technically.
Red: I know you‚Äôre lying just to mess with me!
Sythe: (whispering) Hey, I just figured if you‚Äôre still interested in Raine, you should know all the‚Ä¶ perks.
Red: Shut up!Karen: So what‚Äôs the deal with these floating rocks anyway?
Sythe: Eh. Stuff‚Äôs always floating around volcanoes. This is nothing. You should see the boulders floating around Pint‚Äôs Pass.
Karen: Yeah, I know! But why?
Sythe: Oh. Well, they just do. I dunno.
Raine: It‚Äôs because the magic is coming up from the earth. Places like these are where it‚Äôs finding a way out and being released. Ah! Maren!
Karen: Oh! Oh! Does that mean your magic is all super-charged here? Maybe you can teleport us all to Edinmire!
Nibbly: ??
Maren: Quit squirming.
Raine: Eheh! No. No. It might help a tiny bit, but even if I had full control of my magic, I certainly couldn‚Äôt do that.
Karen: Aw‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ your mom was a super powerful Grand Templar! And Euchre was powerful too! Magic parents, plus magic place, means Super Magical Raine, right?
Raine: I‚Äôm afraid it‚Ä¶ ngh‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt work like that! Sorry to disappoint, but the magic here just causes fluctuations at best.
Raine: Maren, g-go a little easier, please!
Maren: What? It‚Äôs just a tail.Zen: (thoughts) Sigh‚Ä¶ Hey, Natani. Another update.
Zen: (thoughts) Still no luck getting this thing off without them noticing. Rocks make a lot of noise.
Zen: (thoughts) Thought again about running for it, but as much as it pains me to admit, I do need these guys.
They have my map and supplies. They know the way and they know Trace and Flora. They can get me to you
if I can just keep being patient. I just wish I knew what was happening on your end. I keep telling myself
this stupid thing is just blocking your thoughts from getting through‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶
Zen: (thoughts) But‚Ä¶ what if I‚Äôm wrong? What if I‚Äôm talking to no one? What if I can‚Äôt hear you because this
thing severed the link? What if I get it off just to find out you‚Äôre‚Ä¶ That you‚Äôre‚Ä¶
Zen: (in Keidran) Rrraaah! Natani! Please! Just say something!
Natani: Zen?
Red: Hey! I don‚Äôt know what you just said, but pipe down over there!Keith: Natani? What is it?
Natani: I‚Ä¶ I just heard Zen! He‚Äôs still blocked for some reason, but maybe‚Ä¶ Zen?
Natani: (thoughts) Zen?
Natani: (thoughts) Zen, if you can hear me, do not go to Edinmire! Do not go! It‚Äôs not safe for
wolves right now. I mean, more so than usual. I‚Äôm not there, anyway. I‚Äôm in a carriage headed
to the‚Ä¶ uh, Legacy‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm headed to the Grand Templar‚Äôs place! It‚Äôs outside the city,
north, in the mountains. Go there! Just do not enter Edinmire!
Zen: What‚Ä¶ did I imagine that? No, no! It was Natani! I felt it, just for a second!
Zen: (thoughts) Natani‚Äôs okay! Oh, thank you! Gods, masks, whatever!
Zen: (thoughts) Don‚Äôt worry, Nat. Your big bro will be there soon. I‚Äôm almost to Edinmire!CLEP! CLOP! CLIP! CLOP!
Soldier: SIGH‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm stuck here on babysitting duty. I know someone had to, but
Edinmire‚Äôs still burning. I should be down there! Besides, there‚Äôs something weird going on with these
two‚Ä¶ If I didn‚Äôt know better, I‚Äôd think they were‚Ä¶ no, no, stop imagining things.
Flora: (whispering) Trace, that Brahn guy has me worried. The Templar know we‚Äôre here now. They might
be tied up with the wolves at the moment, but‚Ä¶ You know he‚Äôs going to try something.
Trace: (whispering) I know, Flora. But the guard still seems to recognize my authority. Them keeping
an eye on Natani means them also watching out for us.
Flora: (whispering) Just be careful, Trace. I‚Äôm not going to let them take you away from me again.
Trace: (whispering) Heh. Don‚Äôt worry. I have no intention of leaving your side.
Soldier: Ah, jeez! Uh‚Ä¶ O-oh! Looks like we‚Äôre coming up on the estate! Thank the gods‚Ä¶
Trace: We are? But I don‚Äôt see any‚Äî ‚Ä¶woah.The Legacy Estate
Trace: That‚Äôs the estate?!
Soldier: Yes? I mean, technically the land is part of it too, but that‚Äôs the main house.
Trace: House? That thing is a castle! Why in the world did I need a place that big just for me?
Soldier: I‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt presume to know, sir. Though, I have heard you would often host guests of‚Ä¶ unusual size.
Soldier: Oh! Speaking of, there‚Äôs Reni now. I suppose she must have flown ahead to meet‚Ä¶ with‚Ä¶
SLUUUURP
Soldier: ‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) Sir Templar, Guardswoman! Greetings! I - I was just waiting for you!Alice: Lt. Alice Reed, guard reserve, reporting!
Reni: (thoughts) _Uh‚Ä¶ Princess Reni. Dragon. ‚Ä¶At ease?
Alice: It‚Äôs an honor, Miss Reni. How are things in the city?
Reni: (thoughts) Not‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôm afraid.
Reni: (thoughts) There are still fires burning around Shepherd‚Äôs Square. But the Wolfpen was their true objective. No telling yet the extent of the breach. And with wolves disguised as humans, no way to know where lese they might be. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a mess. [I hope the captain is okay‚Ä¶] Anyway, I was told prisoners were being sent here. So I‚Äôve come to lend my protection.
Reni: (thoughts) But first‚Äî you.
Trace: M-me?
Reni: (thoughts) Forgive the suspicion‚Ä¶ But I must ask you to let me into your mind‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ so I may ensure you are who you claim to be.Reni: (thoughts) Wait, this isn‚Äôt right. Why is‚Ä¶? Oh. I see. Your memories were lost! This explains a great deal.
Trace: (memory) Where‚Ä¶ am I?
Keith: (memory) I‚Äôm a Basitin! She‚Äôs Keidran.
Reni: (thoughts) You‚Äôve been through a lot. Still, I sense there‚Äôs something you‚Äôre trying to hide. Whatever it is, I ask you show me!
Flora: (memory) Mrreow~! Trace!
Reni: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶Oh. Oh dear!
Flora: (memory) Ah!
Reni: (thoughts) No no no! Nevermind! Next! Sorry! That‚Ä¶ I-I didn‚Äôt think you‚Ä¶ with a Keidran?! Oh, my‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) O-okay, now‚Äìwait! ‚Ä¶Nora?
Nora: (thoughts, memory) I cannot say how long this sleep of mine will‚Äì
Nora: (thoughts, memory?) You know, young one, it‚Äôs rude to pry.
Trace: (memory) Huh?
Reni: (thoughts) Graaalr!
Alice: Ma‚Äôam? Are you alright?Reni: (thoughts) Ehem. I apologize.
Reni: Grrarg‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) It seems you are indeed who you claim to be. Though the circumstances are not quite expected. Nevertheless, if Lady Nora vouches for you, then that is good enough for me.
Reni: (thoughts) If you wish, I can try to fill you in later on anything you need. But for now‚Ä¶ May I please have your permission to rest here in your home for the time being?
Trace: Oh, uh‚Ä¶ sure, I guess.
Reni: (thoughts) Thank you. It‚Äôs been a long day. I suspect you and your‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶companions feel the same.
Reni: (thoughts) Ah, speaking of which‚Ä¶ It looks like the rest of them have finally arrived. I suggest we take this inside.
Eric: Well, this place sure beats the pants off my manor.
Mike: Erg‚Ä¶ kinda regret saving this stuff now.
Keith: (in Keidran) Guess this is it. Hm. Not a bad place to get imprisoned.
Natani: (in Keidran) Oh, great, another giant lizard.Trace: So, uh‚Ä¶
Trace: Do we‚Ä¶ knock, or‚Ä¶?
CLUNK! CREEEEEK!
Roselyn: Ah, master. I see you‚Äôve finally returned‚Ä¶ quite a lot later than scheduled. I‚Äôd heard you‚Äôd died.
What a shame.
Alice: It‚Äôs a wolf!
Roselyn: Guardswoman, if you find me threatening, I weep for Edinmire. Ah‚Äôm Rose‚Äì er, I am
Roselyn, the seneschal of this residence.
Alice: All domestic wolves were relocated! How is it you were not taken with the other wolves?!
Roselyn: If your guards think they could take me from this place, I would be very impressed.
Roselyn: Well, come in, it‚Äôs cold out there. I‚Äôll make tea.Trace: This entrance is huge!
Alice: As I said, dragon-sized. It‚Äôs been a fad among nobles to be able to host such guests, no matter how unlikely
that is. ‚Ä¶Though in your case, I suppose it‚Äôs more legitimate.
Reni: (thoughts) It‚Äôs one fad I actually do appreciate. I can‚Äôt even count the number of times I‚Äôve hit my
head on a doorframe.
Reni: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶Seven.
Keith: Well, should be plenty of guest rooms. After today, I‚Äôm exhausted.
Alice: Woah, hey now! That wasn‚Äôt part of the deal. The arrangement was: we allow you to stay here, if you and
your wolf friend stay in the dungeons. Remember?
Trace: No one is going in the dungeons. This is my house (apparently) and therefore they are my guests.
Alice: But Captain Keiren said‚Äì!
Reni: (thoughts) Ms. Reed, it‚Äôs okay. I know for a fact now they have no connection to the city attacks. And I can
keep my eyes on everyone regardless of where they are.
Reni: (thoughts) Though you are mistaken, Trace. The dungeons here will still see use.
CLICK!
PLOP!
Group member: The wolf from before! It‚Äôs alive?
Reni: (thoughts) Yes, I made sure of it. Once he is secured, I hope to learn more about what‚Äôs behind this
attack.Keith: Thank you. ‚Ä¶Again.
Trace: Of course. You guys are my friends. I‚Äôd never let anyone go to the dungeons.
Keith: Trace, listen. I‚Ä¶ I want to say I‚Äôm sorry for how I acted before we left the ship. After Natani collapsed, I just‚Ä¶ I was lashing out. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I shouldn‚Äôt have blamed you for not being able to help. I certainly shouldn‚Äôt have hit you before of that.
Keith: So, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm‚Äì
WUMP!
Keith: ‚Ä¶Ow?
Flora: Trace!
Trace: There!
Trace: Even. That‚Äôs the Basitin way to do it, right?
Keith: ‚Ä¶heh‚Ä¶ eheh‚Ä¶
Keith, Trace: Ah-heheheh!
Flora: Ugh‚Ä¶ Boys.
Natani: (In Keidran) Okay, what did I miss? Keith laughing is unnatural.Eric: So‚Ä¶
Eric: So‚Ä¶ Anyone else find it odd that Trace has a Keidran for a seneschal? I mean, no offense, Trace. But we all know how you were with Keidran - especially wolves.
Evals: Don‚Äôt seem weird to me. Rich humans and Keidran servants go hand-in-hand in my experience. Who better to lord over?
Eric: Yes, but Trace is‚Ä¶ was a rather extreme case. And why would he have a portrait of her here? Something strange about this place‚Ä¶
Eric:‚Ä¶Though I must admit, Rose was pretty cute, once upon a time.
Roselyn: I‚Äôd like ot think I still am, but thank you.
Eric: Eeeek!
Roselyn: To answer your question, I didn‚Äôt belong to Master Trace.
Roselyn: I belonged to her.
Roselyn: She employed me, and had me painted. She‚Äôs the reason the painting and I are still here.
Trace: Saria‚Ä¶Trace: Ngh‚Ä¶
Trace: Damn them.
Flora: Trace?
Trace: Ah?
Flora: Are you alright? More memories?
Trace: Eh, no, just‚Ä¶ emotions this time. I‚Äôm alright.
Flora: Are you sure?
Trace: Yeah. With you I am, Flora. Though, maybe we should skip the tea. I‚Äôd like to lie down.
Roselyn: Uh‚Ä¶ very well, master. Your bedroom is prepared as always.
Natani: (In Keidran) Man‚Ä¶ so much gold. I‚Äôm really tempted to pocket some of this stuff.
Natani: (In Keidran) ‚Ä¶Huh. Snow wolves usually all look the same to me, but the one in this painting looks strangely‚Ä¶ familiar.
Natani: (Thoughts) On second thought, maybe I shouldn‚Äôt.
Keith: (In Keidran) You two know each other?
Natani: (In Keidran) Uh, erm‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs nothing. Snow wolves and forest wolves just don‚Äôt get along, is all.Roselyn: The Legacy Estate has never hosted quite such a‚Ä¶ diverse group of guests before. I am aware Basitins in particular have requirements when it comes to sleeping arrangements.
Roselyn: But I assure you, there‚Äôs plenty of space. We have two wings on this floor, so male Basitins may take one separely if they so desire.
Roselyn: Distribute yourselves as you see fit. Please note, the third floor is off limits.
Flora: Hey! Hear that? Looks like we‚Äôre finally staying somewhere where you two won‚Äôt have to share the same room!
Flora: (In Keidran) Or even the same wing! Isn‚Äôt that great?
Keith: (In Keidran) Oh‚Ä¶ great.
Natani: (In Keidran) Y-yeah. Good. Finally.
Keith: (In Keidran) B-but you know, after what happened with Natani‚Ä¶
Natani: (In Keidran) Oh, yeah! I‚Äôm not nearly 100% yet‚Ä¶
Keith: (In Keidran) Just to be safe, I should prooobably be nearby‚Ä¶
Natani: (In Keidran) Yes! Safety!
Roselyn: ‚Ä¶Okay.
Roselyn: (In Keidran) We have adjoining rooms in the east wing, if‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what you desire. Feel free to call for me if you need anything else. Otherwise, good night.Lynn: Ehem‚Ä¶
Lynn: (In Basitin) I hate to.. be the one to bring this up‚Ä¶ Howeverm Basitin law is clear about this: you cannot remain in a room overnight with.. someone of the opposite sex.
Keith: (In Basitin) Wha-? B-but Natani‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ er‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve never‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not like that!
Keith: (In Basitin) Natani‚Äôs my friend. After everything that‚Äôs happened‚Ä¶ I just want to spend some time together! Like I would with any other guy! It‚Äôs not fair that I can‚Äôt do that just because of‚Ä¶ how they look!
Lynn: (In Basitin) I know it doesn‚Äôt seem fair. But now that you‚Äôre a Basitin citizen again‚Äî
Keith: (In Basitin) But we‚Äôre not even on the Island anymore!
Lynn: (In Basitin) Yes. But nevertheless, you are our Ambassador. You, more than anyone, represent our people to the world.
Keith: (In Basitin) I never asked to be that! The Basitins on the island don‚Äôt even want me to be that!
Lynn: (In Basitin) Unfortunately, for many, what we are is not a choice we make. We‚Äôre stuck with the cards life has dealt us.
Keith: (In Basitin) Well I‚Äôm sticking with Natani.
Natani: ?
Keith: (In Basitin) Besides, like Roselyn said, it‚Äôs an adjoining room. Technically two rooms. So no laws are going to be broken tonight.
Lynn: (In Basitin) Of course, sir. ‚Ä¶If you say so.Caption: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Karen: Mwahahaha‚Ä¶
Mrs Nibbly: Eek!
Karen: Ah! Sythe! Your pet squirrel is so cute! I could just eat her up!
Mrs Nibbly: Eek!
Maren: Ew! Karen, put that thing down! You don‚Äôt know where it‚Äôs been! Honestly, where did that thing even come from, anyway? No normal squirrel hangs around a bunch of predators. It must be diseased.
Maren: Right, Raine?
Raine: Snnrx-! Huh? Wha-? Oh. I dunno. I think we‚Äôd notice by now if it was. She was probably someone‚Äôs pet, maybe. Although‚Ä¶ hm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve read that baby dragons shapeshift into other creatures in order to experience the world.
PADDLE! PADDLE!
Sythe: Dragon?
Sythe: Is that it, Nibs? Are you actually a fierce, fire-breathing dragon under that fur?!
BOOP!
Sythe: Well, if it‚Äôs true, at least she‚Äôs a friendly dragon!
Maren: Euck! Whatever it is, just keep it away from me.Maren: Aaand‚Ä¶ done.
Maren: I wish I had the rest of my old grooming kit. I‚Äôd like to be able to do your nails too. I have to admit, this was‚Ä¶ fun. It brings me back to the days when I wanted to be a groomer.
Maren: At least until‚Ä¶ well, with a name like Taverndatter, I didn‚Äôt have much ch- h-hey!
Raine: Ngh‚Ä¶
Maren: Raine!
Sythe: Aw, poor girl. Us wolves need less sleep than humans, but once we‚Äôre out, we‚Äôre out.
Karen: I think she‚Äôs got the right idea. I‚Äôm headed to bed too. Later, sis.
Sythe: As am I. Looks like you‚Äôve been volunteered first watch, Maren.
Maren: Wha- hey, wait! Give me a hand with her, I‚Äôm pinned here! She weighs a ton!
Maren: Guys?! This isn‚Äôt funny! Eep-! Raine! No nuzzling!Kathrin: Natani!
Kathrin: (In Keidran) Before you go, I wanted to give your new robes back. Thank you again for‚Ä¶ saving my life.
Natani: (In Keidran) Ah. No problem.
Kathrin: (In Keidran) One more thing! Remember the smallclothes I told you about earlier today?
Natani: (In Keidran) ‚Ä¶No?
Kathrin: (In Keidran) Oh. I mentioned them after you first woke up, but‚Ä¶ I suppose the ship __was__ on fire at the time.
Kathrin: (In Keidran) You see, while you were out, the robes were finished, and then‚Ä¶ W-well, there was extra fabric, and I already had all of your measurements‚Ä¶ So‚Ä¶ To pass the time, I kinda made‚Ä¶ a few different things. J-just as experiments! After working so hard on them, I didn‚Äôt want them to burn up.
Kathrin: (In Keidran) So‚Ä¶ here they are.
Natani: Grrnk!
Natani: (In Keidran) T-these are‚Ä¶
Natani: (In Keidran) __W-why would you think I‚Äôd want something like these?!__
Kathrin: (In Keidran) No no no! I swear, it was just for practice! I know you‚Äôre not‚Äî!
Kathrin: (In Keidran) I‚Äôm sorry! I only made them because I was sad when you said you‚Äôd never had clothes that fit. I didn‚Äôt mean to offend you. I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll go take them apart right n‚Äî
Natani: (In Keidran) __No!__ Don‚Äôt! I‚Äôll take them!
Natani: (In Keidran) N-not to wear! Just‚Ä¶ you know, as a memento! I‚Äôve never had things made for me. And I‚Ä¶
Natani: (In Keidran)‚Äù‚Ä¶I appreciate it. Thank you.
Kathrin: (In Keidran) Y‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre welcome.Keith: (in Keidran) What was that all about with Kat? I heard yelling.
Natani: (in Keidran) Nothing! Forget it.. Is‚Ä¶ this our room here?
Keith: (in Keidran) Yeah, I think so. And that‚Äôs the second room over there.
Natani: (in Keidran) Seriously? A chandelier? Gah! That human‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd kill to have this kind of money.
Keith: (in Keidran) Oh, so you‚Äôd start being a competent assassin then?
Natani: (in Keidran) Hey, quiet, of you‚Äôre back on the list.
Keith: (in Keidran) Sure.
Keith: (in Keidran) Huh. When they said ‚Äúadjuning rooms‚Äù I expected a dividing door, not a curtain. Not that I‚Äôm really concerned about Basitin laws here. Though don‚Äôt tell Lynn I said that, or he might schedule himself to have a heart attack.
Keith: (in Keidran) I‚Äôm going to go get out of this armor. Are you sure you‚Äôre‚Ä¶?
Natani: (in Keidran) Keith, I‚Äôm not going to collapse again the moment you leave. Relax. Go.
Natani: (in Keidran) Hm‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) I‚Äôll have to see about making new bindings later. I‚Äôm sure the human has a stash of crystals around somewhere.
Natani: (thoughts) Don‚Äôt wanna sleep in my only clothes. Guess it‚Äôs just fur for now. Well, that or‚Ä¶
Natani: ‚Ä¶
Natani: (thoughts) Tch! Yeah, right‚Ä¶Natani: Keith!
Keith: Ack!!
Natani: (in Keidran) Done yet?
Keith: (in Keidran) Natani! Don‚Äôt do that!
Natani: (in Keidran) What? Why so shy all of a sudden? We were in the baths just yesterday!
Keith: (in Keidran) Natani, that‚Ä¶ was a week ago.
Natani: (in Keidran) Hm? Oh‚Ä¶ right. Coma. Well, whatever. I need your help with something.
Natani: (in Keidran) Here! Read this for me.
Keith: (in Keidran) Huh? O‚Ä¶kay. This is‚Ä¶ well, it sorta looks like a menu. There‚Äôs a long list of random items: Toiletries, food, clothing, drinks‚Ä¶ Where‚Äôd you find this?
Keith: (in Keidran) Wow there‚Äôs some crazy stuff in here! Basitin vintage 221! King Ravlen had the throne back then. Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ dragon whiskey, vixen spirits, white wolf wine‚Äì
Natani: (in Keidran) ‚ÄúWhite wolf wine?‚Äù
Keith: Ah! What-?
VVVVMMM!
CLUNK!Natani: (in Keidran) ‚Ä¶So then I told that younger me: ‚Äúlisten, sister! I don‚Äôt need to rely on Zen to be who I am! I have myself to rely on! Which I guess also means you. So you‚Äôre gunna help me bust out of this place!‚Äù
AH~‚ô•!
Natani: (in Keidran) She agreed, and next thing I know, I‚Äôm in a burning ship!
Keith: (in Keidran) Wow! That‚Äôs how it really happened?
Natani: (in Keidran) Er‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ yeah! That‚Äôs exactly how it went down! More or less. Might have been a little more her convincing me‚Ä¶
Keith: (in Keidran) I see‚Ä¶
Keith: (in Keidran) So then‚Ä¶ everything‚Äôs fixed?
Natani: (in Keidran) Well‚Ä¶ no. The link is suppressed, but it‚Äôs still there. And even if it wasn‚Äôt, no mental pep-talk is going to reverse black magic, or undo years of experience.
Natani: (in Keidran) And I wouldn‚Äôt want it to. Pleasant or not, those years made who I am.
PLOP!
Keith: A-ah‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) But I‚Äôm learning to‚Ä¶ accept the other side of myself a little bit more.This body is mine. And my past is a part of me.
Keith: (in Keidran) I get you. I can‚Äôt pretend to fully understand all this mind stuff‚Ä¶
Keith: (in Keidran) But I‚Äôm glad it means you‚Äôre back.
Natani: (in Keidran) Yeah me too.Keith: (in Keidran) So, that other you, is she‚Ä¶ still in there?
Natani: Uh‚Ä¶
Youngtani: Tell Keith he‚Äôs cute.
Natani: (in Keidran) Well, like I said, mind‚Äôs still fractured.
Natani: (in Keidran) Still, it actually feels pretty freeing. Ya know, having a guy‚Äôs mind and being stuck in a girl‚Äôs body isn‚Äôt the worst thing in the world‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs certainly not the worst body to be saddled with.
Natani: (in Keidran) I mean‚Ä¶ you like it, don‚Äôt you‚ô•?
Keith: (in Keidran) Wha- Natani?! No! I-I means yes! That is, I‚Ä¶
Natani: Ahahahahaha!!
Natani: (in Keidran) You aughta see the look on your face! You‚Äôre so easily frustered. I should have taken advantage of this ages ago!
Keith: (in Keidran) Hey, shut up! Don‚Äôt ever do that girly voice again! It‚Äôs weird coming from you!
Natani: (in Keidran) Haha‚Ä¶ Oh man.
Natani: (in Keidran) Shouldn‚Äôt laugh after eating so much. Sorry‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) Wanna touch ‚Äòem?Keith: (in Keidran) Alright, alright! Now I know you‚Äôre pulling my tail! Cut it out!
Natani: (in Keidran) No, really! It‚Äôs not that big of a deal!
Keith: (in Keidran) They are!
Natani: (in Keidran) Pff! Hey! I just figured I‚Äôd offer, ya know, from one guy to another. But fine, suit yourself!
Keith: (in Keidran) ‚Ä¶Wait, were you really being serious?
Natani: (in Keidran) Eh‚Ä¶ maybe? I mean, if they were on you, I‚Äôd hope you‚Äôd be willing to do the same for me. Anyway, whatever. I‚Äôm gunna get the lights and rest my eyes for a bit, if you don‚Äôt mind.
Natani: (in Keidran) Now, for my excellent Human‚Ä¶ Ehem!
Natani: Ruom! Laights aut!
FWOOSH
Natani: (in Keidran) Hah! It worked!
Keith: (in Keidran) Oh, okay. Well‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt slept much this last week, so I‚Äôm pretty beat too.
Keith: (in Keidran) I guess it‚Äôs about time I - erk!
Natani: (in Keidran) Keith, I wasn‚Äôt saying ‚Äúget out‚Äù. Let‚Äôs be honest. We both know we were lying about the twin-bedroom thing. Come on. How about for once we actually share a bed on purpose?
Keith: (in Keidran) Alright, if you insist.
Natani: ‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) Also you‚Äôre cute.
Keith: (in Keidran) Huh?
Natani: (in Keidran) N-nothing!Eric: Here. For the two of you.
Mike: Huh? W-what‚Äôs this?
Eric: Payment for services rendered. You two officially no longer belong to me. I filed your initial paperwork this morning, before all the‚Ä¶ fireworks.
Eric: I‚Äôve also confirmed the sale with Ms. Roselyn. So, presuming the filing office in the city hasn‚Äôt burned down, you‚Äôre now as free as I can make you.
Eric: I included some extra for saving what you could from the Na‚ÄôRella.
Mike: This‚Ä¶
Mike: ‚Ä¶is for me?
Evals: Well‚Ä¶ wow, uh‚Ä¶ thanks, I guess. And‚Ä¶ thanks for defending us on the docks, as well.
Evals: For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôm sorry your ship went down like that.
Eric: It‚Äôs alright. It‚Äôs no small loss, but it‚Äôs certainly not going to affect me as much as it will for some from this attack.
SIGH
Eric: I am sorry as well, for putting the collar on you. I knew what those things did but I used them anyway, and I regret it. To be honest, this whole ‚Äúvacation‚Äù has given me a lot to think about‚Ä¶
Eric: In any case, good luck to the two of you, whereever you‚Äôre headed from here.Caption: Meanwhile‚Ä¶
Trace: ‚Ä¶This must be where we‚Äôre staying. I guess this used to be my bedroom? It‚Äôs actually more‚Ä¶ normal than I imagined.
Flora: Yeah! Knowing how you used to be, I half expected‚Ä¶ I dunno, Keidran-skinned rugs or something?
Flora: I guess even evil-you liked to sleep in comfort. Still feels weird being here.
Trace: I know. Like invading someone else‚Äôs bedroom.
Flora: Not only that, I think I recognize this place now.
Flora: Yeah, I can see the lights of Edinmire way down there. If it were daytime, I bet I could see the hill on my old farm, too.
Flora: My owner had me on a loose leash, so it‚Äôs where I spent a lot of my time. At night, I would see the lights on the mountainside and wonder who lived up there.
Flora: It‚Äôs weird to think that was only a couple summers ago. I was just a little farm cat.
Flora: And back then, to me you were just this nebulous thing‚Ä¶ the scary guy other Keidran would sometimes whisper about.
Flora: And now here I am, just casually resting in the master bedroom like I own the place‚Ä¶ on what turned out to be your estate. It‚Äôs crazy!
Trace: You mean our estate.
Flora: Yeah, our‚Äì wait‚Ä¶ my‚Ä¶?
Flora: _Gah!_Not helping, Trace!Flora: Trace, while the kitten in me is giddy at the idea of actually getting to live in this piece of my childhood‚Ä¶ You do remember this is just a rest stop for us, right?
Flora: To be honest, I was afraid just being here might reawaken that‚Ä¶ you know, other side of you. So I admit, things
are going better than I expected, wolf attack aside. But‚Ä¶ Lyn‚Äôknoll is still the ultimate goal.
Trace: I know, I know. But it seems like we may be stuck here for a little while. At least until things calm down enough to get resupplied. So why not enjoy it while we have it?
Trace: This place seems safe. The Templar are distracted, and the town guard seem to still consider me in authority‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs even a dragon watching over us.
Trace: And while I‚Äôm not sure how much we can trust Reni, she seems‚Ä¶ nice enough. So what do you say‚Ä¶ Duchess Flora Legacy?
Flora: Duchess‚Ä¶ Legacy?
Twitch! Twitch!
Flora: M-Mrowr~‚ù§!
Flora: Gah! Bad Trace! I never should have told you about that spot! I knew this place would bring out your evil side!
Trace: Hey, I‚Äôm innocent! I just wanted to help you relax, honest!
Flora: Pff! Sure! Well, it‚Äôs working.Sealeen: Man, I can‚Äôt see anything from here. Do you think that really was Trace?
Landen: Dunno.
Sealeen: It had to be, right? They let him in.
Sealeen: But the rumors were he died! And Seer Brahn was heard calling himself Grand Templar. What gives? Do you think it‚Äôs a coup?
Landen: Maybe.
Sealeen: Heh, sorry. Thanks for indulging me with this, Landen. I know I can get a little Templar-crazy sometimes.
Landen: Yup.
Sealeen: Say, in all the commotion, we never did get paid by those Basitin guys. You think they were serious about hiring us?
Landen: Probably not.
Sealeen: Yeah, I guess we did kinda mug them first.
Sigh‚Ä¶
Sealeen: It‚Äôs a shame. One of them was kinda cute.
Sealeen: Hey, Landy? If Trace has come back to reclaim his position, what does that mean for the rest of the Templar order? If it came down to it, who would everyone side with?
Landen: ‚Ä¶Whoever won.Caption: The next morning‚Ä¶
Raine: Ngh‚Ä¶
Raine: Mmph‚Ä¶ Wow, I haven‚Äôt slept that well in ages‚Ä¶
Raine: Huh?  Maren? What are you doing in my tent?
[Insert awkward pause here]
Raine: Yiiiip!! Maren! I-I‚Äôm so sorry! I don‚Äôt even remember falling asleep! Why didn‚Äôt you just push me off?
Maren: You were very heavy.
Sythe: And she wouldn‚Äôt let us wake you up. She cares more than she lets on.
Maren: Shut it, fleabag!
Sythe: Whatever you say, ice queen.Red: Alright, everyone packed and ready? We need to get moving.
Karen: Hang on, I gotta go!
Red: Well hurry up! We‚Äôre bruning daylight.
Sythe: Hey, has anyone seen Mrs. Nibbly this morning?
Maren: It‚Äôs a wild squirrel. Maybe it finally decided to go back home.
Sythe: Nah, she‚Äôs probably just sleepign in one of these trees. Nibs!
Karen: ‚ô´‚ô™
THUNK!
Karen: Ow!
Karen: What the-? Uh‚Ä¶ guys? I think there‚Äôs something wrong with the outside‚Ä¶Sythe: It‚Äôs over here, too!
Raine: It goes all the way around the hot spring!
Red: What the hell‚Äôs going on?
Red: Are you trying something, wolf?!
Zen: What?! Come on!
Zen: (in Keidran) I‚Äôm a Keidran with no mana crystals and wearing a magic suppressor.
Zen: Get real.
Red: ‚Ä¶What?
Raine: A barrier this size would require a lot of magic. It‚Äôs probably being maintained actively by something.
Karen: Raine! What about teleporting us out?
Raine: I only did that once by accident. And even if I could, stuck as a wolf, I‚Äôm just as powerless without mana crystals.
Red: Hey! You‚Äôre all forgetting someone! Alright, stand back!
Red: I may have flunked out of the Templar, but I still know how to blow stuff up!
Maren: Wait, you moron! Maybe we should think about thi-
FWOOM!!
Red: Okay‚Ä¶ maybe I should have stood back a little too. Cough!Carver: Hahaha!
CLAP! CLAP! CLAP!
Carver: Bravo! Well done! It‚Äôs no wonder you flunked out of the Templar.
Carver: Not that many of my, er‚Ä¶ colleagues are much better.
Red: Who the hell are you?! How did you find us?
Carver: You can call me Carver. And finding you was easy. All the other Templar in Edinmire are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. But me? I knew the nearby hot springs were just the place to look for missing wolves. And voil√°!
Red: I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. We‚Äôre not from Edinmire!)
Carver: Mmhm. Sure. Well, either way you‚Äôre mine. Lots of folk looking for wolves these days. Especially‚Ä¶ certain wolves.
Red: You can‚Äôt keep us in here forever! You‚Äôll have to let us out eventually if you intend to capture us!
Carver: Nah! I‚Äôm just going to wait until you all run out of air!
Red: Why you little‚Äì!
Carver: Honestly, at first I was hoping that you wouldn‚Äôt find the barrier until it was too late. But seeing the looks on your faces is so much more fun!
Raine: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶Huh‚Ä¶Red: When I get out of here, I‚Äôm going to wipe that smirk off your face, you little twerp!
Maren: Hey! Quit yelling! We‚Äôll be out of air even faster!
Raine: I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs likely‚Ä¶
Red: Huh? What do you mean, Raine?
Raine: Something doesn‚Äôt add up here‚Ä¶ why is the bubble so big?
Raine: it would take ages for the six of us to run out of air, even without the trees. If he really wanted to suffocate us, he could have put it just around our camp. But it‚Äôs not.
Maren: Maybe he‚Äôs just an idiot?
Karen: YAAAAAAAAH!!
Karen: Blarg!
THUD!
Raine: Maybe. But I think it‚Äôs more likely he‚Äôs trying to keep us distracted. Like I said, a barrier this large should be a huge strain. But he seems fine.
Red: So someone else is making it then?
Raine: That, or some_thing_.
Raine: It would explain the size, if it‚Äôs an item with a preset range. Either way, I think very little this guy‚Äôs said to us has been the truth.
Carver: You know, you guys should really be more concerned about saving your breath. What are you saying over there, Snowball?
Raine: I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre a liar!
Carver: Hm?!Raine: You‚Äôve been lying to use this whole time. In fact, I know you‚Äôre not a real Templar at all!
Carver: Oh? Now that‚Äôs a bold claim. Why would you say that?
Raine: Because I‚Äôve been able to see the real you since you first appeared!
Carver: Huh?!
Raine: It‚Äôs a trick I‚Äôve seen before - an illusion spell. Isn‚Äôt that right‚Ä¶ fox?
Raine: Which makes me think you didn‚Äôt just find us by coincidence.
Carver: Huh‚Ä¶
Carver: Well, shoot. To see through my magic‚Ä¶ hm. What an unusual girl. The boss might be interested in you.
Red: So you were a Keidran all along? Damn it, again! I should have known! Why are you really after us?!
Carver: Pfff! I don‚Äôt care about you at all. Like I said, I‚Äôm hunting for wolves. Certain wolves.
Carver: Wolves like‚Ä¶ you.
Zen: Wha-?! Why me?
Carver: Let‚Äôs just say, you left a lot of loose ends back at the guild. And the person I work for has been very eager to get their hands on you again.Caption: Back at the Legacy Estate
Trace: Yawn! Ah~ It‚Äôs nice to have some fresh clothes again. Ones that don‚Äôt smell like seawater. ‚Ä¶And aren‚Äôt completely covered in tiger fur!
Flora: Thttbt! Love you too, Trace. I‚Äôll make sure it spreads to those soon enough!
Flora : Though I admit I have been shedding quite a lot lately. Not sure if it‚Äôs stress, the baby, or just my winter coat coming in.
Flora: Either way, I could use a bath. And maybe a nice grooming.
Trace: I‚Äôm sure both of those things can be arranged. We can ask that seneschal wolf. After a breakfast, of course!
Flora: Oh, speaking of Roselyn, are we still going to try and keep‚Ä¶ us a secret?
Trace: I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much point. The dragon knows. And if Roselyn hasn‚Äôt guessed already, I‚Äôm sure she will soon enough.
Flora: True. We spent the night in the same room., and we‚Äôre covered in each other‚Äôs scents. It‚Äôs pretty obvious. Still, probably shouldn‚Äôt mention the baby. I doubt she‚Äôd even believe it, but just in case, it‚Äôs best if Rose doesn‚Äôt end up putting it together.
Roselyn: Putting what together?
Flora: MRRREOW!!!PWIP!
Natani: (Thoughts) Alright, who‚Äôs yelling now? Things better not be on fire again, or I swear‚Äì
Natani: Hm?
Natani: (Thoughts) ‚Ä¶Huh‚Ä¶ Guess he isn‚Äôt quite as shy when he‚Äôs asleep.
Natani: (Thoughts) I‚Äôm usually the last person to wake up in the morning. Keith must have really exhausted himself this past week. Tch, idiot‚Ä¶ getting so worked up over someone like me.
Natani: (Thoughts) Weird to think that even a week ago I‚Äôd be freaking out over this. But now‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶
Natani: (Thoughts) I guess we‚Äôre both a couple of idiots. ‚Ä¶And I‚Äôm okay with that.
Natani: (Thoughts) ‚Ä¶
Natani: (Thoughts) Is something poking me?
Natani: Alright, nope! Not quite that okay with it yet! Time to get up!Natani: (Whispering) Zen?
Natani: (Whispering, In Keidran) Zen? Hey, can you hear me? Is anything getting through? Hello?
Natani: Hrm‚Ä¶
Keith: (In Keidran) Back to male again, I see.
Natani: (In Keidran) Huh? Oh, hey!
Natani: (In Keidran) Morning. It‚Äôs about time you were up! ‚Ä¶Or at least the rest of you is now up‚Ä¶ Yeah, turns out the table even spits out magic crystals if you ask it nicely. So the girls are back in the bindings again for now.
Natani: (In Keidran) Why? Disappointed?
YAWN!
Keith: (In Keidran) Eh, honestly, I‚Äôd find it weirder if you didn‚Äôt.
Natani: (In Keidran) Yeah, well, I have a feeling it‚Äôs going to be pretty weird either way once we leave for breakfast, now that the secret‚Äôs out. But‚Ä¶ I guess I can‚Äôt just hide in this room forever.
Keith: (In Keidran) Eugh‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbreakfast?‚Äù How can you even still think about food after last night?
Natani: (In Keidran) I‚Äôm a wolf. Now hurry up, I smell bacon!Flora: M-Mmm~‚ù§!
Trace: Flora! Use your silverware! And don‚Äôt make sounds like that! We‚Äôre not animals! Oh, wait‚Ä¶
Flora: ‚ÄòEy! Mr‚Äôat‚Äôs Ra‚Äôshist! Nom!
Trace: Snrk!
Roselyn: What a charming young woman‚Ä¶
Roselyn: (thoughts) What‚Äôs your game here, Trace‚Ä¶?
Trace: Hey, aren‚Äôt you going to join us too, Roselyn?
Roselyn: W-what? Me? Eat with you?
Trace: Yeah?
Roselyn: I‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt. I must attend to the other guests. There‚Äôs much work to be done. Sir.
Roselyn: Speaking of guests, I saw the dragoness, Miss Reni, earlier. Althought she seemed a bit‚Äî
SLAM!
Reni: (thoughts) Grraawr~! Lousy sun‚Ä¶ Lousy wolves‚Ä¶ Lousy war‚Ä¶ All a bunch of‚Ä¶
Reni: Hiiiiiisssss!
Reni: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶Oh. Hello. P-please excuse my language!Trace: What‚Äôs the matter, Reni?
Reni: (thoughts) Oh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not much of a morning dragon. Since dawn, I‚Äôve been in the dungeon trying to get information out of the wolf we captured.
Reni: (thoughts) It that coffee? Oh, bless you, ma‚Äôam!
Trace: Why don‚Äôt you just read his mind like you did me?
Reni: (thoughts) That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing. It‚Äôs all I can do, since he‚Äôs still yet to regain consciousness. I‚Äôve managed to see how they infiltrated the city, and when they planned their attack.
Reni: (thoughts) So far, from what I can tell the wolf we have now was just a pawn in all this. What‚Äôs been so aggravating is trying to find who his boss is. Who‚Äôs really behind the attack?
Trace: The wolf didn‚Äôt know?
Reni: (thoughts) W-Well‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs just it, I‚Äôm not sure. I can see anything he‚Äôs experienced, but the problem is‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a little embarrassing to admit, but‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) I, uh‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand Keidran.Natani: Hey, hang on!
Reni: (thoughts) Oh, hello. You are the other wolf‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶
Natani: N-Natani. And what do you mean you can‚Äôt speak Keidran? I can understand you right now!
Reni: (thoughts) Oh, right. Yes. We dragons ‚Äúspeak‚Äù telepathically. It‚Äôs universal. You hear my intentions, and as you speak words, I can hear yours.
Reni: (thoughts) I have learned human. But even for me, speaking this way is a necessity. I am limited by my biology just as any creature. If I were to try and speak human out loud in this form, it‚Äôs be‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ Ehem‚Ä¶
Reni: Grash itsh griah! Rwar arrr rawrrawrarar!
Flora: Okay, we get it!
Reni: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶Sorry. A-anyway, a lot of dragons just rely on telepathy. But as I‚Äôve discovered, the flaw with telepathy is that it only works in real time.
Reni: (thoughts) The people in a memory aren‚Äôt real. They don‚Äôt have minds for me to read. Even the wolf whose mind I‚Äôm in doesn‚Äôt translate. People remember their past but not exactly what they were thinking at any given time, usually.
Reni: (thoughts) All I hear are sounds. It‚Äôs frustrating and honestly pretty unnerving to suddenly not understand the sounds that people are making.
Reni: (thoughts) That being said, after listening for a while, one name does come up repeatedly. A name I believe may be of importance in all of this‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) Clovis.
_Red: ‚ÄúClovis‚Äù? Who the hell is that? Another assassin?
Zen: (In Keidran) He‚Äôs the only guy I can think of who might have sent this little twit after me. But no. Clovis isn‚Äôt an assassin. He‚Äôs worse.
Raine: Worse than an assassin? What‚Äôs worse than that?
Red: In human, please!
Zen: (In broken Human) A rich asshole. One I used to owe some money to.
Zen: (In broken Human) He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ well, he likes to call himself the Prince of Greed. He‚Ä¶ uses gold to force.. desperate to work for him.
Zen: (In broken Human) The.. mind link I told you about, between me and my brother‚Äì
Red: Supposed link.
Zen: ‚ÄìHe helped create it.
Reni: (thoughts) So‚Ä¶ you owe this Clovis your life?
Natani: (In Keidran) Eugh! Don‚Äôt remind me. The thought of that slimy bastard poking around in my head‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) And you say you did jobs for him?
Natani: (In Keidran) Not by choice!
Natani: (In Keidran) And before you ask, no, I don‚Äôt work for him anymore, or know what he‚Äôs up to now. We haven‚Äôt crossed paths in years. In fact, last I heard, he pretty much up and disappeared. Odd, considering how much of a playboy he was. I‚Äôd hoped he‚Äôd been offed by somebody. But I can tell you if he is here, it‚Äôs only because he has something to gain.
Zen and Natani: (thoughts) And that means trouble‚Ä¶Carver: (In Keidran) Aw, I‚Äôm sure Clovey will be pleased you still remember him!
Carver: (In Keidran) I am disappointed that your little sibling isn‚Äôt here with you. Don‚Äôt worry, though, we‚Äôll catch that one too. And believe me‚Ä¶
Carver: (In Keidran) Clovis has special plans for her.
Zen: (In Keidran) I won‚Äôt let any of you lay a hand on Natani, you son of a bitch!
BZZZT!
CRACKLE!
Zen: (In Keidran) What the-?
Raine: The shackle!
Raine: I‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs trying to nullify the magic!
Carver: (In Keidran) A magic suppressor? Well isn‚Äôt that just bloody inconvenient. Still, it‚Äôll take you ages to get through like that. And I could just keep refreshing this barrier all day‚Ä¶
Carver: (In Keidran) But I think it‚Äôs time to stop fooling around and wrap this up already!Raine: That‚Äôs it! That‚Äôs what‚Äôs holding up the barrier!
Carver: Hah! I like you, snowball! For a woman, you‚Äôre pretty clever! All book-smarts, I can tell. But I have a surprise for you! Remember when you thought I was bluffing about the air?
SPARK!
FWoOSH!
Maren: Ah!
Karen: What‚Äôs
going on?
Carver: I was going to wait until you realized it had been draining, but I figure it‚Äôs time I sped things along.
THUD!
Carver: Not to worry though, my dear! You‚Äôre going with Zen! I‚Äôll have you both gift-wrapped and on your way to Clovis by
the time you wake up! But as for the rest of you, well‚Ä¶
Sythe: Wait, is that‚Äì?!
Carver: ‚Ä¶I suppose this is goodbye!
Mrs Nibbly: Screeeeee‚Äî!
Carver: Wha-AUGH!!
Sythe: Nibbly!Zen: (in Keidran) The Rod!
Zen: (in Keidran) If I could just reach‚Ä¶
Zen: (in Keidran) Eurgh!
Zen: (in Keidran) It‚Äôs right there! Just‚Ä¶ gotta get to it!
VVWUM!
SSHHHFT!
Zen: (in Keidran) Shackle‚Äôs getting hot, but it‚Äôs working!
Carver: (in Keidran) Get off me you bloody tree rat!
Zen: (in Keidran) Come on!
Zen: (in Keidran) Almost there! Come on! Come on!
SSSSSSSSHHH!
Zen: (in Keidran) RAAAHH!!
SMASH!Carver: I said‚Ä¶ get‚Ä¶
Mrs Nibbly: Squeek!
Carver: ‚ÄîOFF OF ME!!
CRACK!
Sythe: Nibs!
SLUMPCarver: Grr, what now- what the hell?!
Carver: I-Impossible! You‚Äôre a wolf, you can‚Äôt be using magic without crystals!
Raine: I.. I am not a wolf! I am Raine Silverlock, daughter of Euchre and Mary Silverlock!
Raine: I‚Ä¶ am human!
Carver: ‚ÄúSilverlock?‚Äù Why does that name sound familiar?
Carver: Wait‚Ä¶ Oh crap! Welp, this fox knows when it‚Äôs time to bail‚Ä¶
Carver: See ya, girly! I-I‚Äôll be back for you all later!
Raine: No.
Raine: You won‚Äôt.
Carver: Hey, what-
Carver: -Gah!
POP!
Red: Raine! You‚Äôre human again! You alright? Jeez, you straight up disintegrated that guy! That was awesome!
Raine: Ow‚Ä¶
Raine: I didn‚Äôt disintegrate him! Urgh‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt stop him teleporting, so instead I gave him a little push‚Ä¶ with all of my magic. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to end up where he intended.
Red: So where is he going to end up?
Raine: Somewhere a lot farther than ten meters this time.Sythe: Nibs‚Ä¶
Raine: Oh, no.
Sythe: Come on, Nibbly‚Ä¶
Raine: Sythe‚Ä¶ let me see her.
Sythe: She was just stunned, right? She‚Äôs fine. She‚Äôll be back up in a minute!
Raine: Oh, Sythe‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Ä¶ I think her neck was broken.
Sythe: B-but‚Ä¶ you can fix her now, can‚Äôt you? You can use your magic!
Raine: Sythe‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs nothing I can do. I‚Äôm sorry, she‚Äôs just‚Äì
Mrs Nibbly: Squeek?
Sythe: Nibs!
Raine: Wah!
Sythe: Nibs!! You‚Äôre alive! I knew it!
Sythe: You nutty girl! You showed that fox who‚Äôs boss!
Raine: B-but‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I could have sworn‚Ä¶
Raine: ‚Ä¶Huh, I guess I must have been mistaken.Karen: Raine! You need to come quick! It‚Äôs bad‚Ä¶
Raine: Oh, gods‚Ä¶
Karen: He passed out. What do we do?
Raine: Uh‚Ä¶ Maren, get my bag. It‚Äôs got herbs that might help.
Maren: Alright.
Raine: Karen, get as much water from the spring as you can carry.
Karen: O-okay.
Red: Look, I don‚Äôt mean to always be the callous one here, but‚Ä¶ You all do remember who this guy was right?
Red: He‚Äôs the one‚Äì
Raine: ‚ÄìWho saved all of our lives taking down the barrier. And we‚Äôre not going to stand around and let him die.
Raine: Could you help me by tearing up some bandages? Please.
‚Ä¶Yeah. Alright.
[Time Passes]
Raine: There.
Raine: That‚Äôs all I can do.
Raine: But unless he gets some proper care I don‚Äôt know what his chances are.
Karen: U-uh, guys? I think there‚Äôs another problem headed our way!Earlier, at the estate‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) I need to know as much as you can tell me about this Clovis. My duty here is to protect Edinmire, and if he‚Äôs the one responsible for these attacks, I must find him.
Reni: (thoughts, to self) I can‚Äôt let everyone down.
Natani: (in Keidran) Well‚Ä¶ as much as he pretends otherwise, he‚Äôs half fox. Yellow-ish fur, red eyes‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs got a ton of properties and lackies in the wolf kingdom.
Natani: (in Keidran) Rich Prick.
Natani: (in Keidran) But as much as I‚Äôd love to see that pompus git get roasted by a dragon, I‚Äôm afraid there‚Äôs not a lot else I can tell you. He kept me in the dark more so than even my brother.
Natani: (in Keidran) In fact, he took every opportunity to make it clear he thought of me as the lesser of the two of us. For‚Ä¶ various reasons.
Natani: (in Keidran) I had the link of course, but frankly I didn‚Äôt care to listen to him any more than I had to, anyway. Zen could probably tell you more‚Äî Aaaugh!!
CRASH!
Keith: (in Keidran) Natani? What‚Äôs wrong?!
Natani: (in Keidran) My leg‚Ä¶ it‚Ä¶ felt like it was on fire- Aaugh! Something‚Äôs wrong! M-my head! I‚Ä¶
Keith: No! Not again!Going to shackle me, huh? Lots of Folks looking for wolves these days. I‚Äôm almost to Edinmire. A day or two of walking at most. You can call me carver. This lake looks cool! There‚Äôs floating rocks! It‚Äôs some kind of magic barrier. It‚Äôs bad. What do we do?
Zen: I won‚Äôt let any of you lay a hand on Natani!
Natani: Ah!
Keith: (in Keidran) Natani?! Natani, talk to me! What‚Äôs wrong?!
Natani: (in Keidran) I‚Äôm okay! I‚Äôm still here. Still‚Ä¶ me.
Natani: (in Keidran) The link‚Ä¶ Zen and I‚Ä¶ our minds are open again. It was just‚Ä¶ intense.
Keith: (in Keidran) I‚Ä¶ I thought for a second‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) Keith, I‚Äôm okay. Zen‚Äôs mind doesn‚Äôt have the influence over me that it did before.
Natani: (in Keidran) I‚Äôm more‚Ä¶ myself now. What happened last time won‚Äôt happen again, I promise.
Sigh
Keith: (in Keidran) Good. I don‚Äôt know if I could go through that again.
Keith: (in Keidran) So why did it come back now?
Natani: (in Keidran) Not sure. Give me a minute. It was a lot all at once. Zen passed out right when the link was restored.
Natani: (in Keidran) That might have been because of the link, but‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶ Something‚Äôs wrong‚Ä¶!
Natani: (in Keidran) Zen! He‚Äôs in trouble!Natani: (in Keidran) You have to help him! He‚Äôs not far! I-I‚Äôm not exactly sure where but it‚Äôs within a day or two by foot! I could find it!
Reni: (thoughts) I understand your concern for your brother‚Ä¶ B-but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs my duty to keep you here‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) You said your duty was to protect Edinmire by finding Clovis, right? Zen knows! He‚Ä¶ he has information! he can help you, I swear!
Reni: (thoughts) W-well‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ Trace, can you vouch for this wolf‚Äôs word?
Trace: Yes.
Trace: I mean, truthfully, we don‚Äôt have much direct interaction‚Ä¶ But these are all friends of mine. I‚Äôve only caught half the conversation, but I get the gist of it. I say we help.
Reni: (thoughts) Very well! In that case, this shall be a prisoner acquisition mission! Wolf, you‚Äôre with me. I shall read your mind and compare the surroundings as we get closer!
Natani: (in Keidran) R-right. Me‚Ä¶ i-in the air‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) I‚Äôll also take any others willing to go. The city guard handbook recommends recon parties of at least three!
POINT!
Trace: ‚Ä¶Guard handbook? But‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre a dragon.
Flora: No offense, Ms Reni, you‚Äôre big, but not‚Ä¶that big. How exactly do you plan to carry so many people?Natani: (in Keidran) Mmph!
Natani: (in Keidran) Nmmph!
Natani: (in Keidran) Gah! Why did I have to agree to this?!
Natani: (in Keidran) Dragon, I thought you said these things were bigger on the inside?
PANT!
Reni: (thoughts) No‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ said the inside becomes‚Ä¶ as larger as it needs to be. Though ‚Ä¶haah‚Ä¶ I may have overestimated how much weight they reduce.
Keith: I think it‚Äôs kinda cozy.
Natani: (in Keidran) You would! Urg‚Ä¶ either I suffocate inside or see just how high up I am outside.
Natani: (in Keidran) Who could enjoy this?
Flora: This is amazing!
Trace: Flora, be careful! I still think in your condition you should have stayed behind.
Flora: And miss out on this?!
Reni: (thoughts) I‚Äôm making an approach. You all‚Ä¶ may want to hold on to something. This landing could get a little rough!Karen: Look! I told you! There it is again! A dragon! Do you think it‚Äôs after us?
Karen: Maybe it‚Äôs just here for the hot spring?
Maren: Karen!
Maren: Get out of the open before it spots you!
Sythe: I can‚Äôt believe this. First an assassin, now a dragon? I think it‚Äôs wearing armor too. It must be from the Templar! Fates! How are we going to get out of this one?
Raine: M-maybe we can try‚Ä¶ talking our way out? Dragons are usually pretty reasonable creatures. ‚Ä¶A-at least from the stories I‚Äôve read. Wait‚Ä¶ is it just me or does that thing look like it‚Äôs coming in a little‚Ä¶ too fast?
Red: Get down!
WOOSH!Reni: R-rrergh!
Reni: Graurgle!
SLAM!
Trace: Ack!
Flora: Waaah!
Natani: (in Keidran) YAAAAHHH!
THUD
Natani: Oof!
Trace: Uuuurgh‚Ä¶
WUMP!Maren: Woah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never seen a dragon fall out of the sky like that before.
Maren: Do you think it‚Äôs hurt?
Sythe: Who cares? Let‚Äôs get out of here before it gets up again!
Red: Wait! There‚Äôs people. And‚Ä¶ I know that blue hair!
Trace: Is everyone else okay? Keith? Reni?
Natani: (in Keidran) Never. Again.
Reni: Grrawr‚Ä¶
Red: Trace!
Trace: Huh?
Red: Trace, ol‚Äô buddy! I never thought I‚Äôd see you again!
Trace: Gah! My spine!
Red: Oops, sorry!
Red: How you been? What are you doing here?!
Trace: Er, well, here to save you guys, I guess? Where‚Äôs the trouble?
SHOVE!
Natani: Human!
Natani: Where Zen?!Caption: Meanwhile
THUD! THUD! THUD!
SHHHHFFT!
Roselyn: Yes? May I help you?
Templar 1: You! Servant Keidran, open this door! We have orders from Master Templar Seer Brahn.
Templar 2: The wolf terrorist you are holding is to be moved to the tower, where it can be closer guarded.
Roselyn: I‚Äôm sorry. Your timing is‚Ä¶ conveniently unfortunate.
Roselyn: Master Trace is not available right now. I‚Äôm afraid you will not be able to enter the manor without his permission.
Templar 1: Did you not hear us?! We are under orders from Brahn! We will not be denied entry by a filthy beast! And don‚Äôt think we can‚Äôt tell you‚Äôre also a wolf! Trace‚Äôs pet or not, technically, you‚Äôre illegal too! We could take you as well.
Templar 2: And we shall, if you don‚Äôt take us to‚Äî
CLUNK!
Roselyn: You misunderstood me just now. You cannot enter the manor without permission. Physically.
Roselyn: It‚Äôs built into the stone. I‚Äôm giving you fair warn‚Äî
Templar 1: We‚Äôll just see about‚Äî
FWUMPH!
Roselyn: Sigh‚Ä¶ They never listen. Thanks, Nora.
Roselyn: Well, better check the fields and see what‚Äôs become of them. I hope it‚Äôs hens this time. We could use the eggs.Red: ‚Ä¶
Red: Who are you?
SHING!
Keith: Don‚Äôt even think about it.
Trace: Hey, hey, hey! Let‚Äôs not start this here, alright?
Trace: We‚Äôre on the same side. Let‚Äôs just get back to the estate in one piece.
Red: Alright, sorry. I wasn‚Äôt going to attack. Just being cautious, is all. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ been a really stressful morning, you know?
Raine: Hey!
Raine: Hi! Oops, Erm‚Ä¶ [in Keidran] Hello! You must be the sibling Zen spoke of. He‚Äôs okay, for the moment. I can take you to him.
Natani: [in Keidran] Oh‚Ä¶ good. Thank you.
Raine: [in Keidran] Follow me.
Red: ‚Ä¶So‚Ä¶ First a tiger and a basitin, now a wolf. Jeeze, you‚Äôre really trying to collect them all, huh? Well, I‚Äôm just glad to see you‚Äôre still alive, buddy.
Trace: Oh! Yeah, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre still alive too, er‚Ä¶ _uuuh‚Ä¶
Red: ‚Ä¶You don‚Äôt even remember my name, do you?
Trace: Sorry.Flora: Are‚Ä¶ you okay, Ms. Reni?
Reni: Yes. I‚Äôm fine. Only a little winded. (And a little embarrassed about that landing) I‚Äôm just going to lie here for a while.
Flora: I saw a stream nearby. I‚Äôll get a bag and be back.
Sythe: Flora!
Flora: Huh?
Flora: Oh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs you. Hey.
Sythe: Y-yeah, hey! How‚Äôs it going? Been a while.
Flora: I gotta get some water.
Sythe: Flora, wait! Please.
Trace: Oh, right! That‚Äôs what your name was.
Red: Yeah, like the plant.
Sythe: I‚Äôm sorry. I know we didn‚Äôt part on the best of terms-
Flora: You caused assassins to come after us.
Sythe: That‚Ä¶ was my uncle‚Äôs fault. Look, I just wanted to tell you I understand now. Our marriage wasn‚Äôt meant to be, and you weren‚Äôt wrong to run away from it. I‚Äôm glad to see you‚Äôre okay. It looks like you‚Äôre-
Sythe: Like‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre‚Ä¶Sythe: Flora‚Ä¶ are you pregnant?
Flora: ‚Ä¶Yes. Yes, I am.
Sythe: Is it mine?!
Flora: What?! No! Of course it‚Äôs not yours! How could it be?!
Sythe: Oh. Right. But then who‚Ä¶ how‚Ä¶ How far along are you?
Flora: I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. Two months? Maybe a little more?
Sythe: Two months ago? That‚Äôs around the time I last saw her. She was only with the human and basitin, though! There was no one else who could have done it! But‚Ä¶ hang on, two months ago was also around when the assassins were sent out to-
Sythe: ‚Ä¶No‚Ä¶ it couldn‚Äôt be‚Ä¶
Sythe-o-Vision
Natani: Well, you know chicks dig bad boys. Besides, look at this hair. Can you blame them?
Sythe: Him?! The wolf that was sent to kill you?! Why? What did he have that I didn‚Äôt?! It‚Äôs the hair, isn‚Äôt it?!
Flora: You‚Äôre an idiot.Flora: It‚Äôs not Natani‚Äôs! Or anyone else‚Äôs. I‚Äôve only been with one other person since I was with you. And that‚Äôs Trace.
Flora: It‚Äôs his.
Sythe: ‚Ä¶What? You‚Ä¶ and the human?
Sythe: But you‚Äôre‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not possible! You know that, right?
Flora: I know you aren‚Äôt going to believe me. You can think what you want, but it‚Äôs the truth.
Flora: Now, if you don‚Äôt mind, I‚Äôve got water to fetch. I‚Äôd rather not stay here any longer than I have to.
Sythe: But‚Ä¶ it just can‚Äôt be!
Sythe: Then again‚Ä¶ Raine claims her father was a wolf. That was only possible becuse he could shapeshift, but‚Ä¶ I suppose if anyone else could learn to do that, it‚Äôd be a Grand Templar. Still‚Ä¶ The tyrant Trace‚Ä¶ with a keidran child! Is it possible? If the world found out‚Ä¶
Sythe: Wait, hang on! You said two months? Flora! If you‚Äôre in your second trimester you shouldn‚Äôt be lifting heavy things!
Flora: Just because I‚Äôm pregnant doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm helpless! But if you wanna carry it, be my guest!
Raine: (in Keidran) Natani, was it? Over here.
Raine: (in Keidran) We brought him into the shade.
Natani: (in Keidran) Zen‚Ä¶Raine: (in Keidran) Zen‚Äôs condition is stable. But he‚Äôs not out of the woods yet. Infection is the biggest danger now. He‚Äôll need to rest, and be closely monitored for at least a few weeks.
Natani: (in Keidran) I see‚Ä¶ Thank you for helping him. What about his leg?
Natani: (in Keidran) Is it‚Ä¶ will he lose it?
Raine: (in Keidran) I wish I could say. The burn damage was‚Ä¶ extensive and won‚Äôt be as easily mended as a cut would by magic.
Raine: (in Keidran) Even with a healer, I‚Äôm not sure the nerves will be the same.
Natani: (in Keidran) Zen‚Äôs strong. He‚Äôs survived worse. Still‚Ä¶ he looks worse than I thought.
Zen: (in Keidran) Wow, gee‚Ä¶ thanks.
Natani: Zen!
Zen: (in Keidran) Gone for months‚Ä¶ and the first thing you do when you get back is‚Ä¶ insult how I look. I see. You‚Äôre just jealous. I was always the pretty one, and now you‚Äôre afraid a pegleg will just make me sexier.
Natani: (in Keidran) Are you really cracking jokes at a time like this?! I had to hitch a ride on a giant lizard to save your ass, you know! You could at least be more serious about it!
Zen: (in Keidran) Hahaha! Ow! Heh‚Ä¶ Glad to see you too, Nat.Natani: (in Keidran) Seriously, Zen. How are you feeling?
Zen: (in Keidran) I‚Äôm fine‚Ä¶ What about you? Look at your hair. There‚Äôs a‚Ä¶ chunk missing. When did that happen? Looks funny.
Natani: (in Keidran) Zen? You seem a bit‚Ä¶off. I had to block out the link earlier, hang on‚Ä¶
Raine: (in Keidran) W-wait! I don‚Äôt know how your mind thing works, but I don‚Äôt think you should do that!
Natani: (in Keidran) Relax, I know! Lots of pain. I can avoid tha‚Äì
Natani: Eh? Woah‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) Why is everything suddenly‚Ä¶ floating‚Ä¶ Uuurgh~ah!
THUD!
Keith: Natani!
Keith: (in Keidran) Stop collapsing constantly! You‚Äôre going to give me a heart attack!
Natani: Eugh!
Natani: (in Keidran) I didn‚Äôt mean to. Yeesh! What was that?!
Raine: (in Keidran) Sorry, sorry! I tried to warn you. I didn‚Äôt know what else to do for his pain, so‚Ä¶ I just gave him all the herbs I could.
Raine: It‚Ä¶ was a lot.
Raine: (in Keidran) Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised he managed to be lucid afte
Zen: SNNNXRRKK!!
Raine: (in Keidran) Oh. There he goes. Again.
Natani: (in Keidran) Well, let‚Äôs get him moved.
Raine: (in Keidran) Ah, ok. Carefully. I‚Äôm Raine, by the way. I do hope that dragon is safer on the next landing, for Zen‚Äôs sake.
Natani: (in Keidran) No, no, no dragon. We‚Äôre taking a more  direct way back. I hope.
Raine: Oh?LAP! LAP!
Red: So‚Ä¶ new dragon, huh? Where‚Äôd the white one go?
Red: You two were practically joined at the hip for as long as I‚Äôve known you.
Trace: Oh, Nora is‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs a long story. I have a  feeling she‚Äôll be back. This is Reni. We met in Edinmire.
Red: Wait, ‚ÄúReni‚Äù? That‚Äôs the Dragon Princess?
Trace: Uh, yeah? I guess. You know her?
Red: Of course I know her! I mean, not personally. But everyone knows about the royal dragons. What‚Äôs someone like that doing out here in the boonies?
Trace: So she is royalty? I didn‚Äôt even know dragons had a system of government.
Trace: Say, Reni, does that mean Nora takes orders from you?
PPFFF!
Reni: (thoughts) What?!
Reni: (thoughts) Oops‚Ä¶ Sorry‚Ä¶Trace: So‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have authority over her?
Reni: (thoughts) Merciful Nora! No!
Karen: Wah!
Reni: (thoughts) ‚ÄúDragon princess‚Äù is not a dragon title. It‚Äôs a title given to me by humans.
Reni: (thoughts) You were correct earlier. There is no formal dragon government.
Reni: (thoughts) I can‚Äôt speak for all dragons, but most I‚Äôve met prefer to live by their own rules. So, no, I do not have any power over Nora, or most other dragon for that matter.
Reni: (thoughts) In fact, it there were any dragon who could demand authority over others, it would be her. The one thing almost all dragons respect is seniority. Unlike humans, dragons only grow stronger with age.
Reni: (thoughts) And Nana Nora is‚Ä¶ very old.
Reni: (thoughts) Even if she doesn‚Äôt exactly act her age half the time.
Reni: (thoughts) Don‚Äôt tell her I said that!
Trace: Huh‚Ä¶ Nora always seemed to act very casual around me.
Reni: (thoughts) You‚Äôre lucky, then. She can be intense.
Trace: You called her ‚ÄúNana.‚Äù Are you two related?
Reni: (thoughts) Oh, well‚Ä¶ er, yes, technically. I think she‚Äôs my‚Ä¶ great great grandmother? Though‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not saying very much. Most dragons claim to trace their lineage back to her, one way or another. But suffice it to say, when it comes to rank, I am near the very bottom. At least, by dragon standards.
_Karen: Ms Reni! You‚Äôre the first dragon I‚Äôve ever been able to meet up close! I‚Äôm Karen! I think dragons are so cool!
Reni: (thoughts) Oh! Uh‚Ä¶ thank you? (to herself) Those are some strange ears‚Ä¶
Karen: What‚Äôs it like?!
Reni: (thoughts) What‚Äôs‚Ä¶ what like?
Karen: Being a dragon! It must be awesome!
Reni: (thoughts) Uh‚Ä¶ Yeah, it‚Äôs-
Karen: Boop!
Reni: (thoughts) -nice, I suppose? I‚Äôve‚Ä¶ only ever been a dragon, so I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) And honestly, I‚Äôm probably not the best dragon to ask.
Reni: (thoughts) I was raised almost exclusively among humans. The only other dragon I know well is my mother, the former ‚Äúdragon princess.‚Äù We‚Äôre both considered anomalies among dragons.
Trace: So why is that? What started the whole royal dragon thing?
Reni: (thoughts) Erm‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ you see‚Ä¶ many, many human genderations ago, my grandfather‚Ä¶ He uh‚Ä¶ met a human woman. And‚Ä¶ she happened to be the daughter of the human king at the time. And‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ one thing led to another‚Ä¶
Trace: Wait‚Ä¶ are you saying dragons and humans can‚Ä¶ reproduce?
Reni: (thoughts) Y-yeah, I know! Weird, right? Haha!
Trace: But‚Ä¶ how?
Reni: (thoughts) W-well, when it comes to partners, dragons are pretty flexible, and they don‚Äôt care what the masks have to say about it. It‚Äôs definitely not common, though!
Trace: No, I mean physically, how? If she was a human and he was a dragon, how would she even‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) I don‚Äôt know! I assume magic was involved, but she was my grandmother, I don‚Äôt want to think about it!Karen: That‚Äôs amazing! Does that mean your grandma became a dragon? Gasp! Can you make me a dragon?! Can you?!
Reni: (thoughts) I cannot.
Karen: Aw! Why not?!
Reni: (thoughts) Unfortunately, I just don‚Äôt have a lot of experience using magic yet. I couldn‚Äôt turn you into anything if I wanted to.
Karen: What?! But aren‚Äôt dragons just‚Ä¶ made of magic?
Reni: (thoughts) Heheh! We are beings of magic, yes.
Reni: (thoughts) We do have innate abilities, like our shape-shifting, of course. But I‚Äôm afraid even dragons must learn like everyone else. And I‚Äôm still pretty young.
Trace: How old are you?
Flora: Trace! You really should be a little more tactful‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) I‚Äôm 20.
Flora: You‚Äôre only 20 years old?! Jeez, what do you eat?! You‚Äôre already huge!
Trace: Yes, very tactful‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) Hey!
Natani: (in Keidran) Not to interrupt, but we got what we came here for. Think you could send us back now?Reni: (thoughts) Oh! Right, let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶Which compartment was it‚Ä¶ Everything‚Äôs mixed up from the crash‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) Here? No. Oh! Wait‚Ä¶ Got it!
Reni: (thoughts) While I might not know much magis yet, I do come prepared! Here, Trace. This should work.
Trace: Oh, uh‚Ä¶ thanks. ‚Ä¶What is it? Some kind of teleport-y thing?
Reni: (thoughts) It‚Äôs a gate key. Sorry it‚Äôs dragon-sized.
Reni: (thoughts) Normally, you can‚Äôt just teleport into places like your estate. But for convenience, most have a gate set up that acts as a single well-protected entry point.
Reni: (thoughts) If I held it, this key would go to my home in Morlin Hall, but with you, it should go to yours. You can borrow it for now, though I will need it back!
Reni: (thoughts) I‚Ä¶ actually collect magic stuff like this as a hobby. I think they‚Äôre neat.
Karen: Hang on! Does that mean we aren‚Äôt going to get to ride on a dragon?!
Reni: (thoughts) Er‚Ä¶ It‚Äôd be very hard to carry so many people. Sorry.
Karen: Aaaww~!
Trace: Okay, so how do I‚Äì
CRZCK!WOOSH!
Trace: Woah‚Ä¶ I think I get what you mean by ‚Äúgate‚Äù now‚Ä¶
Roselyn: Ah, Master Trace. You‚Äôve returned. Quite a bit faster than last time.
Roselyn: I see you took the backdoor.
Roselyn: It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ been a long time since I‚Äôve seen it open‚Ä¶ Seen‚Ä¶ the outside‚Ä¶
Roselyn: Ah‚Ä¶ and I see we have more guests. I‚Äôll make tea.Keith: Hey hey hey! Back off! Natani! (in Keidran) Help!
Natani: Snrk!
Trace: Miss Reni? Are you going to be able to fit through here?
Reni: (in thought) I‚Äôm not coming. The gatekey can‚Äôt go through itself. I will take the long way back. Now that this is done, there‚Äôs other things I need to check up on, anyway. I‚Äôll return again in the evening to see if either worlf has regained consciousness.
Trace: Oh, okay.  Well, thanks for your help.
Sythe: Huh? Oh! Shoot! I wanted to ask her about Mrs. Nibbly! Where‚Äôd she go?
Flora: ‚ÄúMrs‚Ä¶ Nibbly?‚Äù
Raine: That white wolf servant‚Ä¶ I wonder who she- eh?
Raine: Oh, hello, Nibs. Why are you on me? Poor thing. She‚Äôs shaking like a leaf.
Maren: Probably got spooked by the dragon. I don‚Äôt blame it. Strange, though. It never seemed frightened by anything else.Rose: (in Keidran) What a strange group of people Trace has collected. The estate hasn‚Äôt been this crowded in year. So many guests‚Ä¶
Rose: (in Keidran) And some less welcome than others‚Ä¶
Rose: (in Keidran) Come out. I can sense you lurking. You‚Äôre worse than Brahn‚Äôs pet.
Euchre: (in Keidran) Hello, Rose. Nice to see you again after so long, cousin.
Rose: (in Keidran) Spying, are you, Euchre?
Euchre: (in Keidran) Just watching over family. That‚Äôs my daughter down there, you know.
Rose: (in Keidran) Really? How thoughtful.
Rose: (in Keidran) You should come visit in person then, instead of projecting yourself like that. I‚Äôd be interested to know if that ‚Äúperfect transformation‚Äù of yours can fix being cursed into a barnyard animal.
Euchre: (in Keidran) I think I‚Äôll keep my distance, thank you.
Rose: (in Keidran) Why are you really here, Euchre?Euchre: (in Keidran) You know, it‚Äôs very odd to hear you speak without your drawl.
Rose: (in Keidran) Just get on with it!
Euchre: (in Keidran) Alright‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure by now you‚Äôve noticed that Trace is not the man he once was. I‚Äôve been working to keep it that way, and I‚Äôd like your help.
Rose: (in Keidran) Oh? Do the other Master Templars know you‚Äôre doing that?
Euchre: (in Keidran) Only Sirus. He knows my true nature, but he‚Äôs an ally‚Ä¶ for now. Brahn, on the other hand, is doing everything he can to draw Trace out. He‚Äôs taken to calling himself the new Grand Templar now, but so long as Trace still lives, the order remains divided.
Rose: (in Keidran) So Trace is a game of keep-away between the two of you, hm? What exactly do you want me to do about that?
Euchre: (in Keidran) Nothing. Brahn may find a way to bypass the manor defenses eventually, but for now this place is as safe as any other. I‚Äôm more concerned about you.
Rose: (in Keidran) Me?
Euchre: (in Keidran) You, and this place. For my work to succeed, I need Trace to remain as he is - happy and ignorant, for now. I don‚Äôt want him to keep prying into his past. I‚Äôm sure you know secrets buried here. Keep them buried, please. For the good of everyone. And whatever‚Äôs in that room on the third floor, don‚Äôt let him see it.
End.Caption: Epilogue
Reni: (in thought) Wait. Miss‚Ä¶ Raine, was it?
Reni: (in thought) One last thing. That fox, Carver‚Ä¶ do you know where he ended up? I‚Äôd like to find him, if possible.
Raine: Oh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt know.
Maren: Gah!
Raine: I just wanted him as far away as possible, but my magic surges are unpredictable. Honestly, he could be anywhere‚Ä¶
SWOOSH
Carver: Urgh‚Ä¶
Carver: Damn‚Ä¶ What a trip. That girl‚Ä¶ Silverlock‚Ä¶ related to former Grand Templar Silverlock? Well, that‚Äôs just not fair.
Carver: Hm, I need to get back and tell the boss. ‚Ä¶Leaving out the part where I was defeated by a woman and a squirrel‚Ä¶
Carver: Where am I, anyway?
Basitin Islander: Halt!
Basitin Islander: See, sis? I told you there was a Keidran on the beach!
Basitin Islander: What are you doing on our island, fox?!

Chapter 20
Stories of the EstateZen: Urgh‚Ä¶ My head‚Ä¶
Youngtani: Oh hey, look who it is.
Youngtani: Welcome back to the land of the living, big bro.
Zen: Wah! Who‚Ä¶ Natani? Why did you make yourself look younger‚Ä¶ and a girl?
Natani: Uh, I‚Äôm over here. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ well, basically a piece of myself from before the link.
Youngtani: Man, Zen, you got ripped! Nice abs!
Natani: It‚Äôs a long story. How are you feeling?
Zen: Well, my head hurts. Leg hurts too, now that I think about it. Also, I might be hallucinating. (to himself) ‚Ä¶Two Natanis‚Ä¶
Natani: You were hurt pretty bad. Kat can explain more.
Zen: Huh? Kat?
Natani: Open your eyes, idiot.
Zen: Oh.Kathrin: (In Keidran) Oh, Hello! The infamous brother, awake at last.
Kathrin: (In Keidran) You‚Äôre looking more coherent. Nice to finally meet you in person. I‚Äôm Kat.
Zen: (In Keidran) Uh‚Ä¶ Zen. So‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the damage?
Kathrin: (In Keidran) Well, you‚Äôll be happy to know you haven‚Äôt lost your leg yet!
Kathrin: (In Keidran) But‚Ä¶ I am afraid you won‚Äôt be walking any time soon. You have an infection, and a fever. You‚Äôll need to stay in hed.
Zen: (In Keidran) That explains the headache. How long was I out?
Kathrin: (In Keidran) Over a day! Miss Raine kept checking in on you. Whatever she gave you was strong stuff.
Kathrin: (In Keidran) You‚Ä¶ were actually in an out a few times, but you weren‚Äôt‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶
Zen: (In Keidran) Hm? I don‚Äôt remember. I didn‚Äôt do anything weird, did I?
Kathrin: Uh‚Ä¶
Zen: (In Keidran) Ah‚Ä¶ extra pillows‚Ä¶ thank you Raine‚Ä¶
Kathrin: I‚Äôm not Raine and those aren‚Äôt pillows!
Kathrin: (In Keidran) N-no! Nothing! (In Human) ‚Ä¶but now I‚Äôve got a shirt, just in case!Zen: (In Keidran) Thank you.
Kathrin: (In Keidran) Raine and the others are the ones you should be thanking. Their magic is dulling the pain. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ well, to be honest, with my sewing room sunk, I‚Äôm just trying to stay useful.
Zen: (In Keidran) You have been. I didn‚Äôt just mean for this. I wanted to thank you for helping Natani.
Zen: (In Keidran) Ever since our folks died‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve tried to be the brother dad told me to be. But I just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I keep screwing up. Our minds are joined again, but‚Ä¶ Natani almost seems better for having been apart from me.
Zen: (In Keidran) I think it‚Äôs helped, having other people to open up to for once. Especially regarding‚Ä¶ You know‚Ä¶ the girl side of things. The ‚Äúgirl talk.‚Äù
Zen: (In Keidran) Not exactly something I was qualified for. So‚Ä¶ you have my thanks. I‚Äôm glad Natani found friends to lean on when‚Ä¶ you know, I get my leg burnt off and can‚Äôt be leaned on.
Kathrin: (In Keidran) ‚Ä¶Happy to help.Natani: (in Keidran) Zen‚Äôs up. I gotta go.
Keith: (in Keidran) Want me to come with?
Natani: (in Keidran) Uh‚Ä¶ yeah, but go ahead and finish eating. I want a minute first.
Keith: (in Keidran) Sure, no problem.
Karen: Mree hee hee~!
SNEAK SNEAK
THWAP!
Karen: Yah!
Madelyn: No. Touching. The ears.
Karen: Aw‚Ä¶ Why not?
Karen: Keith let me touch his ears once.
Madelyn: W-what?!
Keith: I did not ‚Äúlet‚Äù you!Madelyn: Listen, human‚Äì
Karen: Karen!
Madelyn: Karman, you can‚Äôt just go around grabbing Basitin ears!
Karen: But why? What‚Äôs the big deal?
Madelyn: You just can‚Äôt, Alright? Now go on, kid, we‚Äôre eating.
Madelyn: Hrmph‚Ä¶
Karen: ‚Ä¶Is it a sex thing?
Madelyn: KPLEK!
Madelyn: No, it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúsex thing‚Äù!
Karen: ‚Ä¶Are you suuure?
Madelyn: Yes! I-it‚Äôs not like that!
Madelyn: Well‚Ä¶ usually‚Ä¶ I-I mean it feels nice‚Ä¶ but not like how you‚Äôre thinking! It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ calming‚Ä¶ affectionate. It‚Äôs only ever done between close family, like a parent to a young child, or‚Ä¶
Madelyn: ‚Ä¶you know‚Ä¶ someone special.
Madelyn: And certainly not between two girls! That‚Äôd be‚Ä¶ inappropriate.
Karen: (in thought) Hmph‚Ä¶ Basitins are weird.
Karen: (in thought) ‚Ä¶Still tempted to touch‚Ä¶Karen: So what‚Äôs the deal with that weird looking Basitin? Why is his ears all floppy and- What?
Karen: How‚Ä¶ where did everyone go?
One Floor Higher‚Ä¶
Trace: Hm? Flor- Oh. Hey, Keith. Have you seen Flora around?
Keith: Nope, sorry. She‚Äôs not in the dining room.
Trace: She wasn‚Äôt in bed when I woke up‚Ä¶
Keith: Maybe you could try asking your servant?
Trace: Eugh‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt call her that. It‚Äôs awkward‚Ä¶ I hate the idea of someone‚Ä¶ belonging to me. Besides, I don‚Äôt know how to find Rose either, even if I wanted to ask her.
Roselyn: Ask me what?
Trace: Gah!
Trace: Stop doing that!
Roselyn: My apologies, master.
Trace: And please, stop calling me master. Just use Trace.
Roselyn: I‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ if you insist.
Trace: Do you know where Flora is?
Roselyn: I know where everyone is. I can show you to her.Trace: Miss Roselyn‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ was actually hoping for a chance to talk with you, alone.
Roselyn:‚Ä¶Oh?
Roselyn: (in thought) ‚ÄúMiss‚Äù? Ech, weird‚Ä¶
Trace: I‚Äôm sure by now you‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve lost my memories.
Roselyn: Well‚Ä¶ I did think at first it might have been an act. Feigning ignorance in order to lure those guests in for some purpose. But evidently not.
Roselyn: You truly remember nothing?
Trace: Just‚Ä¶ bits and pieces. Flora wants me to leave the past behind, but I think ignoring it is a mistake.
Roselyn: Wait, but don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶ want to return to  your former self?
Trace: No! Of course not! I want to know who I was, so I understand what it is I‚Äôm fighting against! And hopefully fix some of the problems I caused! I was hoping you could help.
Roselyn: I‚Ä¶ See. I‚Äôm not sure how much I can tell you - you were quite paranoid by the end - but tell me what you do remember, and I can try to fill in the gaps.Roselyn: The last time I saw you was in the spring. You‚Äôd left in an awful hurry, but I didn‚Äôt think anything of it at the time.
Roselyn: You‚Äôd often be away for weeks or months on Templar business.
Roselyn: I only learned you were missing when some of your‚Ä¶ friends began poking around, looking for you.
Trace: I see. That makes sense.
Trace: The first thing I can remember is waking up in an empty field. I think it was spring.
Roselyn: Do you remember where?
Trace: Uh‚Ä¶ it was just a forest. Maybe Flora might know.
Roselyn: Your‚Ä¶ tiger? She was there?
Trace: Yes! She‚Äôs been with me from the very start.
Trace: We‚Äôve travelled together ever since. I‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôd be right now without her.
Roselyn: I‚Ä¶
Roselyn: ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry, forgive me for asking, but‚Ä¶ What‚Ä¶ exactly is the nature of the relationship between you and that‚Ä¶ young lady?
Trace: Oh, that‚Ä¶ I mean, it must be obvious‚Ä¶ Flora and I are together.
Roselyn: T-together?! But‚Ä¶ not seriously, right?
Trace: Uh, yeah, it‚Äôs pretty serious. In fact, since everybody‚Äôs finally here in one place, and I‚Äôm not sure how long that‚Äôll last, I‚Äôve actually been thinking‚Ä¶ Maybe now might be the right time for me to finally‚Ä¶ propose.
GASP!
Roselyn:** What?!**
Trace: ‚Ä¶Should I have not said that?
Roselyn:** Y‚Ä¶you‚Ä¶ YOU‚Ä¶?!**Roselyn: Ngh‚Ä¶
Roselyn: Mmph!
Trace: Wha‚Ä¶? Ms. Roselyn?! Are you okay? I didn‚Äôt mean to upset you‚Ä¶ Look. forget I said anything about marria‚Äî
Roselyn: Marriage! Ah-hahahaha! You?! With‚Ä¶ with a Keidran?!
Roselyn: The Templar Tyrant‚Ä¶ and a tigress‚Ä¶ The Fates truly do have a sense of humors!
Roselyn: Gods, of all people‚Ä¶
Roselyn: And it‚Äôd be the second Grand Templar in a row! Though no one would know it‚Ä¶
Roselyn: You couldn‚Äôt find a more effective way to throw the world into hysterics! Wolves‚Äôd probably think it  was some sort of alliance, humans  might suspect you were brainwashed,  and tigers‚Ä¶ they wouldn‚Äôt have  a clue what was goin‚Äô on!
Trace: Alright, alright, I get it. It‚Äôs crazy.
Roselyn: Oh, it‚Äôs brilliant! What Ah wouldn‚Äôt give to see the heads of those stuffed-shirts and Templars explode from the news!Roselyn: Ah‚Äôm‚Ä¶ Ahem‚Ä¶ I mean, I‚Ä¶ apologize for the outburst.
Trace: No, no! It‚Äôs fine! Honestly, I‚Äôm happy to see a less formal side of you.
Trace: You don‚Äôt have to put on an act for my sake!
Trace: From everything I‚Äôve heard about my old self, working for me couldn‚Äôt have been easy. If I ever hurt you, I‚Äôm sorry. I don‚Äôt want you to be afraid to speak your mind to me now. I won‚Äôt get mad, I swear.
Trace: And I promise, I‚Äôll do whatever I can to make up for the things I‚Äôve done.
Roselyn: U-uh‚Ä¶
Roselyn: You‚Ä¶ have no idea how weird it is to hear you talk like that. You really aren‚Äôt the old Trace I knew. Over the years, I‚Äôve learned to never get my hopes up, but..
Roselyn: ‚Ä¶What the heck. Call me Rose.
Roselyn: Although, as long as we‚Äôre being honest, just between you and me‚Ä¶ The ‚Äúact‚Äù‚Ä¶ Secretly‚Ä¶ Ah kinda get a kick outta it. You know, playin‚Äô the stern old lady. It‚Äôs usually the only fun I can get, so I‚Äôd like it if you didn‚Äôt let on otherwise.
Trace: Oh, o-of course! ‚Ä¶Rose.Zen: Oh, good. My dear brother has arrived.
Kathrin: Huh?
Zen: He‚Äôs on the other side of the door trying to think up leg puns.
Natani: Pfff, killjoy!
Natani: Hey, Kat! Nice shirt.
Kathrin: Oh right, that‚Ä¶ mind-thingy.
Kathrin: Eheh‚Ä¶ T-thanks, Natani. Zen‚Äôs looking good so far. Just a mild fever.
Kathrin: I know it‚Äôs been a while. I‚Äôll leave you two to catch up. Call for me if you need anything!
Natani: Thanks!**
TWACK!
Zen: Erg!
Zen: You know, hitting me in here doesn‚Äôt actually do anything.
Natani: Yeah, well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd feel bad actually hitting oyu while you‚Äôre already injured. That‚Äôs for being an idiot, getting that damn shackle put on in the first place.
Zen: Yeah, I know, I know, believe me. I messed up, I‚Äôm sorry.
Zen: But‚Ä¶ it all worked out in the end, right? So, are you going ot fill me in on what I missed? Your memories are‚Ä¶ more closed off than usual.Natani: Oh, yeah. There‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ quite a few changes recently you missed out on.
Natani: If Kat didn‚Äôt tell you, I guess the biggest one would be that‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ the secret‚Äôs out.
Zen: Woah, seriously?!
Zen: You mean‚Ä¶ everyone knows that you‚Äôre‚Ä¶?
Natani: Yeaaah. Pretty much. Well, actually, I‚Äôm not sure if Stripes or her human actually saw it, but‚Ä¶
Natani: While they‚Äôre both a little dense, even if they didn‚Äôt notice my scent that day I‚Äôm sure word has spread.
Zen: Wow‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt believe it.
Natani: You really didn‚Äôt know? You usually root through my mind right away for this stuff.
Zen: No, like I said, your memories are closed off to me. I figured you were keeping me out. I could have pushed, but I didn‚Äôt want to pry.
Natani: (thoughts) Huh, weird. I wonder if the link is weaker‚Ä¶ of if my mind is stronger, now?
Zen: So‚Ä¶ how did people react?
Natani: Oh, well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm still kinda waiting for the blowout from it. No one‚Äôs said anything to my face yet, but I can tell some of them look at me different, now. Especially the Basitins and Blondie‚Äôs ship hands.
Natani: I hate that they act different. What does it matter to them whether or not I have breasts?Zen: (In Keidran) Don‚Äôt sweat it, Natani. It‚Äôs just new for them. They‚Äôll get over it eventually.
Natani: Hmph. (In Keidran) Yeah, sure.
Youngtani: (In Keidran) Do people who care ever really just ‚Äúget over‚Äù tits?
Zen: Ah! (In Keidran) I forgot about you.
Zen: (In Keidran) Natani, how long is this thing going to be in here? Can‚Äôt you‚Ä¶ dismiss her or something?
Youngtani: (In Keidran) Hey! A little respect! If it weren‚Äôt for me, we‚Äôd both be charred wolves by now.
Youngtani: (In Keidran) But relax, bro. I‚Äôm not a separate person - just a tiny fractured bit of our subconscious. I won‚Äôt get in the way‚Ä¶ promise.
Zen: (In Keidran) Oh yeah, that‚Äôs encouraging. Hrmph‚Ä¶ I still feel like I‚Äôm outnumbered in my own head now. Don‚Äôt exactly like that. But‚Ä¶ if it means your life isn‚Äôt as tied to the link as it was, then‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs good, at least.
Zen: ‚Ä¶
Zen: (In Keidran) So‚Ä¶ I know we usually avoid the subject, but this other you‚Ä¶ does she‚Ä¶ change things? About‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶?
Natani: (In Keidran) Are you asking if this means I‚Äôve given in to the girly side?
Natani: (In Keidran) Pfff, nah.
Natani: (In Keidran) I mean, I do feel less self-conscious about my body.
Natani: (To self) ‚Ä¶At least in front of one person‚Ä¶
Natani: (In Keidran) But I do still think of myself as a guy.
Natani: (In Keidran) So don‚Äôt expect me to start acting dainty or wearing women‚Äôs clothing all of the sudden.
Zen: (In Keidran) Heh, fair enough. Honestly, if you did suddenly start acting feminine, I‚Äôd be very concerned.Zen: (In Keidran) Well, good to know the more things change, the more they stay the same.
Zen: (In Keidran) The thought of you owning anything frilly‚Ä¶ hah! That‚Äôd be the day!
[Flashback of Kathrin]
Natani: (In Keidran) Ah-haha! Y-yeah, ridiculous!
Natani: (Thoughts) Just gunna‚Ä¶ suppress that memory.
Natani: Oh‚Ä¶
Natani: (In Keidran) Right, there is‚Ä¶ one more thing you should know, before he gets here‚Ä¶
Zen: Hm?
Natani:(In Keidran) There has been‚Ä¶ developments you missed, regarding Keith, which I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd find out sooner or later.
Natani:(In Keidran) Ever since the ship fire, we‚Äôve‚Ä¶ kinda been a little more honest with ourselves, and‚Ä¶ more open about it.
Natani:(In Keidran) So, I guess you could say we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ y-you know‚Ä¶
Zen: (In Keidran) Oh gods, did you sleep with the Basitin?!
Natani: (In Keidran) What?! No!! Of course not, you idiot!
Natani: (In Keidran) Not in the way you‚Äôre thinking!
Zen: (In Keidran) Oh‚Ä¶
Natani: (In Keidran) Not‚Ä¶ yet, anyway.Zen: (in Keidran) Not yet?!
Zen:(in Keidran) Y-you‚Äôre not seriously considering it, are you?
Natani: (in Keidran) I don‚Äôt know! ‚Ä¶Maybeee?
Natani: (in Keidran) It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm making plans or anything. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ the way things‚Äôve been going‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ thinking about it. I mean‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not really any of your business, but‚Ä¶
Zen: (in Keidran) Our minds are linked together, I think it is my business! What happens if I go through your memories and see that?!
Natani: (in Keidran) Wha- then don‚Äôt go through my memories! That‚Äôs your first reaction to this?!
Zen: (in Keidran) But‚Ä¶ what if you lose concentration and can‚Äôt keep your mind blocked while you‚Äôre in the middle of-
Natani: (in Keidran) We are not discussing th- Keith!
Keith: (in Keidran) U-uh‚Ä¶ I- I can‚Äôt come back later‚Ä¶
Natani: (in Keidran) H-how long have you been there? How much did you hear?!
Keith: (in Keidran) Me? Nothing! Nothing at all!Madelyn: Hm‚Ä¶
Madelyn: Alright, let‚Äôs try this again‚Ä¶ One, two, three, four, five‚Ä¶ Six? Six rooms in the second floor east wing‚Ä¶
Madelyn: Why am I having so much trouble mapping this place out?
Madelyn: The count‚Äôs not changing, but‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt feel right. It‚Äôs like my eyes aren‚Äôt seeing something‚Ä¶
Madelyn: There‚Äôs something off about this place‚Ä¶ I can sense it‚Ä¶
Madelyn: ‚Ä¶Just like I can sense someone trying to sneak up on me again-
Madelyn: ‚Ä¶Karman!
Karen: It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Karen‚Ä¶ What‚Äôcha up to, Madness?
Madelyn: Basitin military business! Go bother someone else, kid.
Karen: ‚ÄúKid‚Äù?
Karen: I‚Äôm sixteen. Aren‚Äôt you supposed to be younger than me? What‚Äôs a little girl doing in the military, anyway? I thought Basitins were all supposed to be tough warriors.
Karen: You‚Äôre kinda‚Ä¶ shrimpy.
Madelyn: ‚Ä¶Shrimpy‚Ä¶Evals: Man, this is the life, huh? No work to do, sleeping in as much as we want‚Ä¶
Evals: I always knew being free would be great, but I never imagined it‚Äôd be this good!
Mike: I don‚Äôt think we should get too used to it‚Ä¶
Mike: But yeah, compared to the ship, it‚Äôs definitely a lot more peaceful around here.
Karen: WAAAAAAHHHH!
Madelyn: I‚Äôll teach you to call me a pint-sized excuse for a Basitin!
Karen: I never said that!
Evals: Ah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gunna miss this when we all start going our separate ways. Eh, Mike?
Mike: ‚Ä¶Yeah.
Evals: Anyway, I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs a grand spa bath somewhere in this place. That‚Äôs what I need!OASIS ROOM
Evals: Wow!
Evals: ‚ÄúOasis‚Äù is right! What is this? Are we outside?
Mike: Can‚Äôt be. It was snowing, and the manor‚Äôs nowhere near a beach.
Evals: But I can smell the ocean‚Ä¶ and it feels warm‚Ä¶
Flora: Rawr I‚Äôm a tiger shark!
Evals: Baaugh!
Flora: Oh, it‚Äôs just you two. Sorry, I thought‚Ä¶ Have you seen Trace lately?
Evals: Can‚Äôt say I have. Thanks for soaking my new robes, by the way.OASIS ROOM
Evals: Ah‚Ä¶ ‚ù§
Evals: Man, now this‚Ä¶ this is freedom. I could stay here forever.
Mike: I‚Äôm still a little confused where ‚Äúhere‚Äù even is. Did we actually leave the estate?
Flora: Nah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just a really big room made to look like a real breach, using some kind of magic.
Flora: Don‚Äôt try to run too far down the shore. You will hit a wall.
Flora: ‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt ask me how I know that‚Ä¶
Flora: Heh‚Ä¶
Evals: It feels real enough to me.
Evals: I don‚Äôt see why Trace even bothered with all the tyrant stuff when he could have been kicking back in his own personal paradise at home!
Mike: Well‚Ä¶ He did end up losing the one person he‚Äôd hoped to enjoy it with.Evals: What‚Äôs up, Mike? You‚Äôve been down practically since we got here.
Mike: I‚Äôve just been thinking. Mostly about where we‚Äôre going from here.
Mike: This might be the last time we see‚Ä¶ A lot of us.
Evals: Yeah, I guess, but why worry about it? There‚Äôs still plenty of time. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre in any rush.
Evals: I, for one, can‚Äôt wait to head for home.
Flora: Wait‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not planning to continue on with us?
Evals: Pff, no. I‚Äôve heard your plans. I don‚Äôt intend to go traipsing through tiger territory chasing after some mythical village where everyone supposedly lives in harmony.
Evals: But dog territory is on the other side of the world. How are you going to get there?
Evals: By sea, of course. Eric‚Äôs got contacts. He told me he might be able to pull somet strings once the port‚Äôs fixed.
Flora: Eric?! We just freed you from him, and you‚Äôre going back to him for help? I thought you didn‚Äôt like Eric?
Evals: I don‚Äôt like Eric. But as much as I hate to admit it, I trust him more than I would any other random captain out there. Eric‚Äôs a lot of things, but he‚Äôs not a liar. When he says he knows a gal who can smuggle me home safe, I believe it.
Evals: Home‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm as far as I‚Äôve ever been, but I‚Äôve never felt closer.Flora: Evals, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre happy. But I think you should be careful not to get your hopes up too high.
Evals: Huh?
Flora: I‚Äôve been where you are. When I first escaped, I went back to my people too. But I had no friends, and I never found any of my family.
Flora: I was just‚Ä¶ alone. It didn‚Äôt turn out like I‚Äôd hoped it would.
Evals: Yeah, okay, but then everything worked out for the best, right? I‚Äôll be fine! I don‚Äôt know how tigers are, but we dogs are communal. We stick together!
Evals: Back home, I had over two dozen brothers and sisters, and twice as many cousins! Everyone was family. And I know they‚Äôre still out there, somewhere. I was the only one dumb enough to wander too far out and get caught.
Evals: You know, Mike‚Ä¶ I can put in a good word for you with some of the lady dogs!
Evals: I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll all come to love you like I do. Trust me, it‚Äôll be great! You‚Äôll be a part of the family in no time.
Mike: Uh‚Ä¶ Evals‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not going to be there.
Evals: What? Of course you will be!Mike: Evals, I‚Äôm not going with you. I told you before, I don‚Äôt have a place in Keidran society.
Evals: Of course you do! You‚Äôll be with me!
Mike: Dogs hate foxes.
Evals: What? N-no! They‚Ä¶ eh‚Ä¶ n-not all of them‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt.
Evals: Mike, would you really rather risk trekking through tiger lands than go back home with me?
SLURP
Mike: That‚Äôs not the point. The point is it‚Äôs not home for me over there.
Evals: Home is where you make it! It‚Äôs family!
Mike: Evs‚Ä¶
Evals: And who knows if you‚Äôll find that over there!
Evals: Mike‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre my family too. We‚Äôre a pack! We dogs stick together!
Mike: Evs‚Ä¶
Mike: I know going back has been your dream since we were kids. I don‚Äôt want anything to stand in the way of that.
Mike: But‚Ä¶ I need a place where I belong too. I‚Äôm sorry. Once we leave‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs probably going to be the last time we see each other.THUNK!
Roselyn: This is the north tower study.
CREEEEAAK
Roselyn: For information about your past, you might find some of it in here. Much of it is from back when you made your plans to overthrow Grand Templar Silverlock.
COUGH!
Trace: Wow, compared to the rest of the estate, this room hasn‚Äôt seen a broom in a while, has it?
Roselyn: O-oh‚Ä¶
Roselyn: ‚Ä¶Apologies, Master.
Roselyn: I would have, but‚Ä¶ You specifically made this one of the areas out of bounds to me. I can go-
Trace: Rose! Calm down!
Trace: Not old Trace, remember? It‚Äôs fine, relax. And please, don‚Äôt call me Master. Just Trace.
Roselyn: R-right, sorry!
Roselyn: EH-HEH!
Roselyn: Force of habit. It‚Äôs going to take a long time to get used to this.Roselyn: Ah! Here, sir-
Trace: Trace.
Roselyn: Trace‚Ä¶ You should hold on to this.
Roselyn: Gate Key. It will open a doorway back to the gate in the garden from wherever you are.
Trace: It‚Äôs a lot smaller than Reni‚Äôs.
Roselyn: They‚Äôre not normally that large. Keep in mind, the gate only opens for you, and only for a limited time.
Roselyn: After which, it takes a long time to recharge, So I suggest saving it for an emergency.
Trace: Thanks, Rose. I can see how this might come in handy‚Ä¶
Trace: ‚Ä¶How safe are we here?
Roselyn: Well‚Ä¶
Roselyn: The estate is protected by many enchantments and dragon magic. It is one of the safest places in the world to be‚Ä¶
Trace: But‚Ä¶?
Roselyn: ‚Ä¶But your former associates are quite crafty and insidious. I fear nothing will stop them from eventually finding a way in, or drawing you out, given time.
Trace: That‚Äôs what I figured. I think Flora and I should have the ceremony as soon as we can, then-
Roselyn: Ah!
Trace: Rose? Are you okay?
Roselyn: Someone is not where they should be!
Trace: Huh? What do you mean? How do you know?Karen: Haha! Can‚Äôt catch m- Aaahh!!
Madelyn: Rah!
Karen: Oof!
Karen: Ow‚Ä¶
Madelyn: Hah! Haa‚Ä¶ haah‚Ä¶ See? Being a Basitin warrior doesn‚Äôt just mean brawns.
Madelyn: No one‚Äôs as fast or as agile as me. I don‚Äôt need to be huge, no matter what anyone says! I don‚Äôt need to be like my- Huh?
Madelyn: What the‚Ä¶ Okay, I know for a fact that this hallway wasn‚Äôt on any of my maps‚Ä¶
Karen: Cool!Madelyn: How could I have missed an entire wing of the estate? Weird.
Madelyn: Air smells stale‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs been here in a long time.
Madelyn: Hm‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs another door at the end of this side passage.
Madelyn: This one‚Äôs a lot less fancy, though.
Karen: Trace always did have a thing for dragons. No wings on this statue, though. It‚Äôs more like‚Ä¶ a lizardfolk.
Karen: Y-you know, Maddie, I‚Äôm really not usually the cautious type, but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm kinda getting a bad feeling about this place‚Ä¶
Madelyn: Relax, I just want to look.CREAK
Madelyn: !
Madelyn: Get down!
SMASH!
Karen: Wah!
RAAAAAAH!Madelyn: Run!!
ROOOAAAR!
Karen: Yaaah!
SMASH!
Madelyn: This was a mistake! Let‚Äôs get out of here!
Karen: Maddie! Something‚Äôs wrong!
Karen: The way we came from‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a dead end!Madelyn: Karen! Go for the door! I‚Äôll try to keep it distracted!
KWRAAAAH!
Madelyn: Ah!
SMASH!
SHOVE!
SLAM!
Madelyn: Augh!
Karen: Maddie!
Maddie!
Maddie!
Madelyn: Urg‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not good‚Ä¶Karen: Hey Scaly! Over here! Yaaaaah!!
CRACK
Karen: Ow! Ow! Ow!
SHUFF
SWOOSH!
Karen: Wah!
Madelyn: Karen‚Ä¶ you idiot, just run! Ergh, think, Maddie! This trap wouldn‚Äôt stop mom. What would she do in this situation?
Adelaide: HRAAAAAAH!!
Madelyn: Yeah, probably‚Ä¶ Okay, now what am I supposed to do in this situation, damn it!Trace: Rose! talk to me, what‚Äôs wrong? Who‚Äôs in danger?
Rose: Ngh!
Rose: Trace, there are places in the estate I have no influence over! You didn‚Äôt trust me with free reign everywhere!
Trace: Influence? What are you talking about?
Rose: There‚Äôs no time!
Rose: I can explain later, but if you really care about the lives of the others, I need to have access to all the rooms of the estate, now!
Trace: O-okay! Sure! Go ahead!
Rose: You have to say it! Say that you lift the restrictions you placed on me!
Trace: Fine! I‚Ä¶
Evil Trace: No!
Trace: I remove your restrictions!
Karen: Ah!
Madelyn: Karen!
SHNNK!
Madelyn: W-wha‚Ä¶?
FSST!
Madelyn: Ah!
FSST!
Karen: Wah!
SMASH!Karen: Ngh‚Ä¶
Karen: Eugh‚Ä¶ what happened? Where are we?
Chicken: BAWK BAWK
Karen: COUGH
Karen: And why is it so cold and dusty in here?
Karen: Ah! Maddie! Oh no‚Ä¶ Wake up‚Äì!
Madelyn: I am awake, dummy. We‚Äôre in a dungeon. I‚Äôm fine.
Karen: But you got hurt‚Ä¶
Madelyn: I said I‚Äôm fine. It‚Äôs just bruised ribs. I‚Äôm a Basitin.
Karen: You don‚Äôt sound fine to me. What‚Äôs wrong?
Madelyn: . . .
Madelyn: You‚Äôre not a Basitin. You wouldn‚Äôt understand.
Karen: I can try.
Madelyn: When I was born, the old goats were so excited. A new Adelaide.
Madelyn: My mother was already a living legend by then. The embodiment of what it means to be a Basitin.
Madelyn: But as I grew up, it quickly became obvious I wasn‚Äôt going to end up like her‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhat a waste.‚Äù They‚Äôd say. ‚ÄúMaybe next time.‚Äù No matter how much I excelled in other ways, I was always seen as a disappointment.
Madelyn: And the old goats were right. Cunning can only take you so far. I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to help you. Or myself.
Karen: Madelyn, anyone would have had trouble with that big lizard. And you‚Äôre just a kid. You could still grow to be like her one day!
Madelyn: Karen, I‚Äôm not actually a kid. I‚Äôm seventeen. My mother was twice my size at my age.Karen: 17? You‚Äôre a year older than me?
Madelyn: Pretending to be younger isn‚Äôt hard. I don‚Äôt act much. With my personality, it comes natural.
Madelyn: And it‚Äôs not as though looking young hasn‚Äôt been useful. Working for the intelligence branch, I infiltrated Western Basitin villages many times.
Madelyn (past): Excuse me! Can you help? I‚Äôm lost!
Madelyn: People often let their guard down around cuteness.
Madelyn: It‚Äôs not exactly a tactic that garners a lot of respect, but it was my only real option. I don‚Äôt have the strength of my mother, or the raw intelligence of an Alabaster.
Madelyn: And I‚Äôm good solo, but I don‚Äôt have the battle tactics of an Alaric. There just wasn‚Äôt a path for someone like me to go any further. There was no getting out from under her shadow. But then‚Ä¶
Madelyn: Keith‚Ä¶ an ordinary Basitin, with nothing special about him, became the first in living memory to return from banishment.
Madelyn: I watched him act in ways I‚Äôd never seen‚Ä¶ ever defying the generals, and with the help of an Alaric, becoming one himself. A new one. An I realized, he din‚Äôt have to be super strong or smart. Being an ambassador‚Ä¶ it was another path for me.
Madelyn: ‚Ä¶I wanted to do what he did.
Madelyn: I wanted to learn everything about the outside world‚Ä¶ so I could come back and show them‚Ä¶
Madelyn: That I have my own worth‚Ä¶ that I‚Äôm not just a failed verison of my mom‚Ä¶Madelyn: W-what are you doing, you weirdo? Get off me! We‚Äôre not family. Hugging‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt appropriate!
Karen: You said you wanted to learn everything about the outside world. Well this is just what humans do when we see that someone‚Äôs sad.
Madelyn: ‚Ä¶
Madelyn: Thanks.Trace: Rose? Is everyone safe now?
Rose: I‚Ä¶
Rose: I‚Äôd almost forgotten. This feeling‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like a veil was lifted‚Ä¶ one I wasn‚Äôt even aware of. I can see now‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs where that thing was kept‚Ä¶
Trace: Rose!
Rose: Yes. They‚Äôre safe now. I sent them to the dungeons.
Trace: The‚Ä¶ dungeons?!
Rose: It was the default place. I didn‚Äôt have time to think about it once the restrictions were lifted. I could send them elsewhere now, but I figure they deserve a time out.
Trace: Rose‚Ä¶ are you okay?
Rose: Me?
Rose: Yes‚Ä¶ sorry. This is just‚Ä¶ a bit disorienting.
Trace: What is?
Rose: ‚Ä¶As you may have guessed, I‚Äôm not a normal servant.
Rose: An estate this size simply can‚Äôt be run by one person. That didn‚Äôt stop you from trying. In your eyes, there wasn‚Äôt a problem that couldn‚Äôt be solved with magic.
Rose: I am‚Ä¶ integrated. Like a spider-web, I can feel everything happening in or around the walls. I can understand now why you kept me restricted. This much control is dangerous. I still can‚Äôt outright attack you, but it‚Äôd be trivial for me to arrange your demise now.
Trace: But you wouldn‚Äôt, right?
Rose: ‚Ä¶No, of course not.
Trace: Why did you hesitate like that?!
Rose: I had to think about it.Red: Raine? You up yet? It‚Äôs already past noon!
Red: Hello? Is this the wrong door?
Sythe: Hey, Red. Looking for Raine?
Red: Yeah, she must have been really tired after what went down yesterd- huh? What‚Äôs with the getups?
Sythe: Didn‚Äôt you hear?
Sythe: Apparently there‚Äôs a fancy magic beach in the manor. I figured after all that went down, we deserve to have a little fun and relaxation.
Sythe: You know, a ‚Äúthank the gods we‚Äôre still alive‚Äù party.
CREAK
Sythe: I hear the others survived something the other day too so its fitting!
Maren: Honestly, I‚Äôm just glad I get out of that potato sack I was wearing. Not exactly sure how I feel about wearing the clothes of Trace‚Äôs dead ex-wife, but I can‚Äôt really afford to be picky. I want to enjoy the stay here as much as possible before this whole place explodes or something.
Sythe: Hey, don‚Äôt jinx it!
Maren: What? I‚Äôm just being realistic. Simply staying in the same house as Trace paints a giant target on our backs.
Maren: And given our track record, well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll take whatever I can get.
Sythe: You have a point. So you coming, Red? I mean, there‚Äôll probably be other Keidran there, and I know how you feel about that, so‚Ä¶
Red: Beach party‚Ä¶ Raine‚Ä¶ swimsuit‚Ä¶
Maren: Of course that‚Äôs where his mind goes.Red: Have to be around a bunch of fleabags‚Ä¶ But get to chill on a beach with Raine‚Ä¶
Red: Fleabags‚Ä¶ Raine‚Ä¶
Maren: Don‚Äôt strain yourself. Later.
Red: Huh?
SLAM!
Red: Raine!
Red: Raine? Aren‚Äôt you coming out?
Raine: I‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Red: Why? What‚Äôs wrong?
Raine: It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to say. It‚Äôs embarrassing.
Red: Raine, it‚Äôs okay! You can talk to me! Is‚Ä¶ is it a wolf thing again?
Raine: . . .
Raine: Sigh‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt want you to see me like this.
Red: Oh!
Red: That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ different. Raine, what happened?
Raine: I don‚Äôt know! I thought maybe after yesterday I finally had more control, but then this morning I woke up this way, and my room was a mess. I think I was sleepwalking.
Raine: That‚Äôs never happened before. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs as if spending so long in wolf form made it used to being out, and it‚Äôs trying to get out again.Raine: I‚Äôm just going to stay in my room. I can‚Äôt go out like this. Even if I do change back, I could shift again at any time.
Red: Raine, it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ that bad.
Red: Besides, this place is already a man-agony!
Raine: A‚Ä¶ what?
Red: You know‚Ä¶ lots of creatures?
Raine: Uh‚Ä¶ wait, a menagerie?
Red: That‚Äôs it! There‚Äôs wolves, tigers, basitins, even a bloody dragon living here‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not going to matter to anyone how you look.
Raine: But it matters to me! And it seems to still matter to you. I heard you talking outside‚Ä¶
Raine: ‚ÄúFleabags‚Äù?
Red: What? No! That‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶
Red: (thoughts) Damn it, I did it again! I need to watch what I say‚Ä¶
Raine: How I look isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm most worried about, anyway. The sleepwalking‚Ä¶ it scares me. What if it‚Äôs just the beginning? What if it keeps getting worse? You‚Äôve heard of feral Keidran, haven‚Äôt you? Losing my body is one thing, but losing mind mind‚Ä¶! I could end up becoming more and more like a wolf! Until eventually I‚Äôm just an animal who doesn‚Äôt even remember who she was anymore much less-
Red: Raine!
Red: Listen to me: you are not going feral! I promise!
Red: You just need to learn more control.Raine: I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know how. My father is the only one who ever did.
Red: You know‚Ä¶ I had a thought about that. The story you told me about your father‚Ä¶ you also mentioned he had a cousin named Rose, right? I couldn‚Äôt help but notice the caretaker of the estate also happens to be a white wolf like you‚Ä¶ named Roselyn.
Red: Quite a coincidence, don‚Äôt you think?
Raine: Maybe? I had the same thought when I saw her, but she‚Äôd have to be pretty old for a Keidran to be the same wolf.
Red: Well let‚Äôs just go ask her! If she knew your dad, maybe she knows something about his abilities, too?
Raine: I guess she might. Though if it is her, she may not want to have anything to do with me. I am the daughter of the wolf who left her to die, after all.
Red: Raine, you can‚Äôt be afraid to ask or you‚Äôll never know! Just be confident!
Raine: I wish it was that easy.
Red: Pfff! Being confident is easy! You just have to speak your mind and don‚Äôt care if you look foolish!
Raine: Well, you certainly do that a lot.
Red: Yeah, I‚Äì hey!
Raine: Heheh!
Raine: You know what‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre right!
Raine: I‚Äôm not solving anything moping around here!
Raine: I need to learn to stand on my own two‚Äìwah!
BLARG!
Red: You‚Äôre legs are still uneven.
Raine: I noticed.Red: Look, you just wait here. I‚Äôll go find Rose, wherever she is, and bring her here as fast as possible!
Red: Be right b‚Äî
Red: ‚Ä¶Wow, I‚Äôm good.
Red: Eh, hullo, m‚Ä¶ ma‚Äôam? My name is‚Äî
Roselyn: I know who you are.
Red: Wha‚Äì huh? Have we met?
Roselyn: No, but I was aware of you. Long ago.
Roselyn: Master‚Äôs childhood cohort. You were quite the bully, if I recall. One of the reasons why I didn‚Äôt like Saria associating with Trace, considering the company he kept.
Red: Man, I can‚Äôt want until we get to be full-fledged Templar! Then we‚Äôll crush those filthy fleabags! And anyone else who gets in our way! Right, Trace?
Trace: Uh‚Ä¶ yeah, whatever.
Red: Well, like you said, that was‚Ä¶ a long time ago. Anyway, this isn‚Äôt about me!
Red: It‚Äôs my friend, Raine, She‚Äôs‚Äî
CLUNK
Red: Uh‚Ä¶ okay, I guess I‚Äôll wait out here then.Roselyn: Hello, dear. I see we have quite the mess on our hands‚Ä¶
Raine: Oh, yes. I-I‚Äôm so sorry about the curtains Miss Roselyn.
Raine: I was sleep walking. It was the wolf.
Roselyn: Not what I was referring to, but yes, the curtains are a mess as well. They, at least, are easily mended.
FLUMPH!
Raine: Oh!
WAG! WAG!
Raine: That‚Äôs fascinating! I saw the runes on the table and wondered how they worked! I couldn‚Äôt read a lot of it, but I could tell it was very elegant runecrafting. It‚Äôs not making the objects, right? It must be some sort of complex summoning circle, but all networked together, sourcing from a central storage room catalogue. It‚Äôs brilliant! I‚Äôt‚Äï
Raine: I‚Äôd‚Ä¶ er, s-sorry‚Ä¶
Roselyn: You like magic, do you?
Raine: Well, I have no real training, but I loved reading about it. I‚Äôve read everything I could get my hands on.
Roselyn: ‚Ä¶.You really are your father‚Äôs daughter.
Raine: So‚Ä¶ you know who I am! You are the same Rose! Does that mean you know about my father‚Äôs abilities? Anything that could help me?
Roselyn: Sigh‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs shameful that neither my cousin nor your mother was willing to guide you in magic‚Ä¶
Roselyn: But yes‚Ä¶
Roselyn: I can help teach you control. We are family, after all.Raine: You have the same ability?!
Roselyn: It runs in the family. Though your father‚Äôs adaptation was unique.
Roselyn: For me, it requires mana. For your father‚Ä¶ and now you, it comes naturally.
Raine: I‚Äôd hardly call this ‚Äúnaturally.‚Äù
Roselyn: Only because you were never allowed to grow into it!
Roselyn: Your parents stunted your growth - the bastards - but you‚Äôre an adult now. You make your own choices. So‚Ä¶ you wanna learn or not?
Raine: Y-yes, ma‚Äôam! Very much so! Uh‚Ä¶ So, w-what do we do first?
Roselyn: Well, we could start by evening you back up. It‚Äôll be hard to train you if you can‚Äôt even walk.
Raine: Well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve tried! If I know how, there wouldn‚Äôt be a problem! But no matter what I do‚Ä¶
Raine: ‚Ä¶It just won‚Äôt go back to normal.
Roselyn: I see‚Ä¶ well, why not try making the other one wolf too, then?
Raine: O-oh. That‚Ä¶ might work. But if I do, then‚Ä¶
Roselyn: You don‚Äôt want to lose more of your human self? Or are you afraid you might end up full wolf again?
Raine: ‚Ä¶Both.
Roselyn: I understand your feelings, but if you want my help, I must insist. I need to see you transform for myself.
Raine: Ah‚Ä¶ o-okay. I guess I can try‚Ä¶
Roselyn: Good. Learning may not be easy‚Ä¶ But I promise I will help you be more whole by the end of this.Raine: Alright‚Ä¶ carefully‚Ä¶
Raine: Don‚Äôt shift all the way‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt shift all the way‚Ä¶
Red: Woah, freaky‚Ä¶
Raine: Gah! Don‚Äôt watch me while I‚Äôm changing!
Roselyn: Out.
Red: Sorr‚Äì ack!
Sythe: Hey, did you hear that?
Maren: Tch! The nerve of that pervert.
Raine: Eh‚Ä¶ well, it worked, I think. Sigh‚Ä¶ back to dog legs. I guess it is better than being unable to walk.
Raine: The other arm changed too, though. I couldn‚Äôt stop it.
Roselyn: Fascinating‚Ä¶ was it painful?
SCRATCH SCRATCH
Raine: No, never. It does kinda itch sometimes.
Roselyn: Hm, good. Painless means it truly is the same ability as Euchre‚Äôs. Though I‚Äôve never seen it stopped halfway like this. Strange.
Roselyn: I think I know of a way to help you gain more control over your wolf side‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôre not going to like it. In fact, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you outright refused, once you learn what it‚Äôll take.Raine: I‚Äôm willing to try anything to fix this!
Roselyn: You shouldn‚Äôt say that before you know what it is.
Raine: I don‚Äôt care what it is. I‚Äôve lived in fear of this curse my whole life‚Ä¶
Roselyn: That is the problem. The way you talk about your ability‚Ä¶
Roselyn: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs trying to get out‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIt was the wolf.‚Äù You act as though it‚Äôs your wolf form itself that you‚Äôre fighting against‚Ä¶ as if it were alive.
Raine: It does kinda feel that way sometimes‚Ä¶
Roselyn: But it‚Äôs not.
Roselyn: Your Keidran shape is just that: a shape, an ability, a skill that requires training like any other. But I do think the first step is to conquer this subconscious wolf you‚Äôve made in your mind. Here‚Ä¶
Roselyn: If you‚Äôre truly willing, wear this.
Raine: Okay‚Ä¶ what is it?
Roselyn: It‚Äôs a Templar slave collar.
Raine: Ah!
Raine: Are you out of your mind, old wolf?! Why would I ever wear one of these?!
Roselyn: Because‚Ä¶ it only works on Keidran. As a human, it shouldn‚Äôt have any effect on you at all. But if it does, well‚Ä¶ I guess you‚Äôll have no choice but to overcome the wolf and change back, now won‚Äôt you?Raine: (Thoughts) I‚Äôm desperate to master this ability, but using this seems so‚Ä¶ dangerous. Could such an evil device really help? I should refuse‚Ä¶ but if it will, then‚Ä¶
Raine: ‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt.
Roselyn: Well, like I said, I‚Äôm not surprised. If you won‚Äôt do this, there are easier ways we can try first. They won‚Äôt be as effective, but you will get results in time. Honestly, I picked the most drastic method I could think of first to see how you‚Äôd react. I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs a cautious mind in that head of yours. That‚Äôs good. You‚Äôd be a fool to just blindly‚Äî
Raine: Uh‚Ä¶ actually, I already put it on. Wait, was I not supposed to?
Roselyn: Lesson one: Slap yourself.
Raine: Huh?
SLAP!
Raine: Wah! What the‚Äì?!
Roselyn: That‚Äôs for putting it on! ‚Ä¶And calling me old!
Raine: You told me to!
Roselyn: Yes, but you didn‚Äôt even question it! What if I had ulterior motives? You can‚Äôt trust anyone so recklessly! Everyone is capable of betraying you!
Raine: We‚Äôre family, though!
Roselyn: Especially family!
Roselyn: Out of anyone family can‚Ä¶
Roselyn: ‚Ä¶can‚Ä¶
Roselyn: Er, sorry. Nevermind.Raine: You‚Äôre talking about my father, aren‚Äôt you? I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ so sorry for what he did‚Äì
Roselyn: Don‚Äôt be. Just try to be more cautious. Everyone has an agenda.
Raine: That‚Äôs a little‚Ä¶ pessimistic.
Raine: Well‚Ä¶ the collar‚Äôs on now. So, how does it help me?
Roselyn: Hm‚Ä¶ Hold out your left arm, please, until I say stop.
Raine: Woah!
Roselyn: Do you feel the magic influencing you?
Raine: Yeah! It‚Äôs like my arm has a mind of it‚Äôs own. Freaky!
Roselyn: Your problem is you never naturally learned to shift as a child. Straining aimlessly trying to change back won‚Äôt do anything if you don‚Äôt even know what to feel for. Instead, I want you to try and resist the collar. Use its magic to help you focus your effort.
Roselyn: Go ahead.
Raine: Just‚Ä¶ lower my arm? Easy enough‚Ä¶
Raine: Nrgh‚Ä¶ I said‚Ä¶
Raine: Easy‚Ä¶ enough‚Ä¶ Rgh!!
Roselyn: Stop.
Raine: Heugh‚Ä¶ Thank you.
Roselyn: Not easy, is it?
Roselyn: My hope was that by practicing to actively control it, this exercise would help you develop a better feel for your wolf form. But if you can‚Äôt resist even a little, I do think this is a bit too much for you.
Raine: No! I want to keep trying! Having something to focus on‚Ä¶ I think it does help!
Roselyn: ‚Ä¶You sure? You know it won‚Äôt simply be holding out your hand. It‚Äôs only going to get more difficult.
Raine: Whatever it takes, I‚Äôm ready! I can do this!
Raine: I will gain control over myself! Both forms!
Roselyn: (Thoughts) Well, she‚Äôs determined, I‚Äôll give her that. I wonder how long until she regrets this.Karen: Wow, that was cool, Maddie! How did you learn to pick locks like that?
Madelyn: Eh, it‚Äôs no big deal. Just a skill I needed as an infiltrator.
Karen: Wait, what‚Äôs that sound?
Madelyn: Something‚Äôs coming down the hall!
Karen & Madelyn: The statue! It‚Äôs back!
Both: AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
Reni: (thoughts) What in the world is going on down here? Statue?
Karen: Reni!
Madelyn: Oh, thank goodness. It‚Äôs just a dragon.Karen: I didn‚Äôt know you were back, princess!
Reni: (thoughts) I‚Ä¶ just returned. I came to check on the prisoner. But what in Nora‚Äôs name are you two doing here? The dungeons are no place for children.
Reni: (thoughts) And‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre injured!
Madelyn: It‚Äôs fine! Yeesh. I‚Äôm a Basitin, trust me, this is nothing.
Madelyn: We were attacked‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) What?! Attacked?! Who? When?! The wolves attacked the estate?!
Madelyn: Huh? No, it was‚Äì
Reni: (thoughts) Did they get the prisoner?! Where is he?! If he got out then I‚Äôve got to‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶to‚Ä¶
Brutus: (In Keidran) Come on, magic-y-appearing chicken‚Ä¶ Come to Brutus‚Ä¶
BAWK! BAWK!
Brutus: (In Keidran) ‚Ä¶Hey.
Karen: Hello!
Reni: (thoughts) Oh thank goodness.Reni: (thoughts) Wait, you‚Äôre awake?!
Brutus: (In Keidran) ‚Ä¶You‚Äôre not going to eat me, are you?
Reni: (thoughts) What?! Ew, no!
Madelyn: (In Keidran) But she might if you don‚Äôt talk!
Reni: (thoughts) H-hey!
Madelyn: (In Keidran) So, who you workin‚Äô for? Where? What‚Äôs his plan?
Brutus: (In Keidran) U-uh‚Ä¶ I work for the boss‚Ä¶ Clovis. And the rest‚Ä¶ I dunno?
Madelyn: (In Keidran) Don‚Äôt play dumb! You must know something! What‚Äôs your rank?
Brutus: (In Keidran) Rank? Well‚Ä¶ I am Brutus! The boss‚Äôs personal bodyguard! And‚Ä¶ I - I just do whatever the boss says! He likes that I don‚Äôt bother with questions. In fact, he once told me when drunk that I‚Äôm the one wolf he enjoys having around most! Though he did make me swear later never to tell anyone he said that.
Brutus: . . .
Brutus: (In Keidran) Whoops.
Karen: So? What‚Äôd he say? What‚Äôd he say?!
Madelyn: Augh! I dunno! I couldn‚Äôt pay attention. He‚Äôs not wearing any pants!
Reni: (thoughts) A-alright, that‚Äôs enough! You two can‚Äôt just interrogate the prisoner like this! Lt. Reed needs to be here for a proper, legal questioning.
Reni: (thoughts) In the meantime, I‚Äôm going to escort you both back to the manor.
Reni: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶ and maybe find some pants.Karen: ‚Ä¶Then I tried to distract it, and that big dumb lizard almost squashed me! _Er‚Ä¶ _no offense.
Reni: (thoughts) None taken. You two are very lucky to have survived a stone guardian!
Karen: I guess it was partially our fault for snooping where we shouldn‚Äôt have.
Karen: Oh, speaking of which, Maddie! Didn‚Äôt that weird door open? Did you get a look at what was in there?
Madelyn: Oh, yeah! I almost forgot.
Madelyn: I was pretty disoriented, but I did see it. There was‚Ä¶ something.
Madelyn: A bright red glow, and‚Ä¶ I swear I saw‚Ä¶ what was it?
Madelyn: I‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt remember.
Karen: Maddie! Your nose, it‚Äôs bleeding.
Madelyn: Hm?
Madelyn: Huh‚Ä¶ yeah. Guess I was a little more beaten up by that dumb rock than I thought.
Reni: (thoughts) . . . . .
Reni:(thoughts) Would you mind if I took a look for myself?
Madelyn: Huh?Madelyn: Woah, this feels weird‚Ä¶ Well? Do you see it?
Reni: (thoughts) I‚Ä¶ Sorry, I‚Äôm afraid not. I saw the door, and the fight‚Ä¶ But y-you‚Ä¶ must have been pretty dazed. I couldn‚Äôt see it either.
Karen: Aw, man! All that trouble for nothing.
Madelyn: Oh well.
Reni: (thoughts) ( ‚Ä¶It was just as I thought, the memory was removed. And not just the memory, but even the idea of trying to go back again. It simply won‚Äôt occur to either of them. )
Reni: (thoughts) ( That‚Äôs dark magic. Troubling. What could be going on in this place? )
Reni: (thoughts) ( Something sinister‚Ä¶ I can smell it. )
Karen: Oh, hey there, sis!
Maren: Karen. Staying out of trouble, I hope?
Karen: Nope!
Karen: What about you? Going to spend the day on the beach with Syyyythe?
Maren: I don‚Äôt like how you just put that, but yes.
Madelyn: _Naked!
Reni: (thoughts) Well, you two seem to have found your friends, So I guess it‚Äôs time I took my leave for now‚Äì
Karen: Wait, Reni! Come party with us!
Reni: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶beg your pardon?
Karen: We‚Äôre all going to the magic beach! You should come too! It‚Äôll be fun.
Reni: (thoughts) M-me‚Ä¶?Reni: GRRAARRRL!
Reni: (thoughts) Thank you, b-but I‚Äôd just be a third wheel. Besides, I can‚Äôt‚Äì!
Karen: Aw, come on! The prisoner‚Äôs not going anywhere. Why not relax for a little while?
Reni: (thoughts) No, I mean I can‚Äôt, literally. My‚Ä¶ erm‚Ä¶ hips won‚Äôt fit through human doors like this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve tried.
Karen: Oh. Right. But so? I heard even baby dragons can transform into animals. Just turn into something smaller! Like a horse, or a cat, or‚Ä¶ ooh! A puppy! Can you be a puppy?!
Reni: (thoughts) I am not turning into a dog!
Reni: (thoughts) Strangers try to pet me. It‚Äôs very awkward.
Reni: (thoughts) But‚Ä¶
Keiren: Reni‚Ä¶ this is off the record, but‚Ä¶ Could you keep an eye on the rest of them too? Especially Trace and‚Ä¶ the tiger.
Keiren: I don‚Äôt trust the Templar or Trace. It can‚Äôt be a coincidence, them showing up the same day we‚Äôre attacked. I‚Äôd just like to know where they plan to go from here.
Reni: (thoughts) I don‚Äôt like the idea of spying, but I guess this might be a good chance to get closer to them‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) I suppose I could try‚Ä¶ erm‚Ä¶
Karen: I‚Äôll be right back! I need to go change. Change? You mean your form, right?
Karen: Unless‚Ä¶Evals: I get how you feel, Mike. I do. I just‚Ä¶
Evals: I always thought we‚Äôd stick together. If it was anything else, I-I would‚Ä¶
Mike: Hey‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt worry about it! I know. You‚Äôve talked about going home since we were kids. I don‚Äôt want to spoil the mood.
Mike: Let‚Äôs‚Ä¶ just enjoy partying these last few days! ‚Ä¶While we can.
Maren: Damn! Get a load of this place.
Flora: Oh, thank the masks, more people.
Flora: I don‚Äôt even care that it‚Äôs our ex‚Äôs, just save me from this awkwardness.
Sythe: Wow, there really is a beach! Though I‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre surprised. Wasn‚Äôt Trace your boyfriend?
Maren: Hmph. He was. Though I‚Äôm not sure what I was to him.
Maren: Suffice it to say, he never invited me here before.
Sythe: Huh.Roselyn: Stand!
Roselyn: Jump!
Roselyn: Run in place!
Roselyn: Roll over!
Roselyn: Sit!
Red: ??
Raine: Do so many of these have to be commands you‚Äôd give to a dog?!
Roselyn: All the better to motivate you. Come now, this isn‚Äôt even a particularly strong collar. You‚Äôre not even trying.
Raine: I am!
Roselyn: SNRK
Roselyn: Well, the more you experience it, the faster you should learn to overcome it. Balance on one foot.
Raine: Ack! Do you know how hard that is with these dumb legs?!
Raine: Ngh‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre enjoying this, aren‚Äôt you, you old wolf?
Roselyn: Such accusations. And what did I say about calling me old?
Raine: That‚Äôs not a ‚Äúno.‚Äù
Red: Hey‚Ä¶ Everything still alright in here? It‚Äôs been a while. The others are probably waiting on us.
Red: Uh‚Ä¶ why are you standing on one leg like that?
Roselyn: Boy, I thought I told you to stay- Hm‚Ä¶Roselyn: Actually, your friend is right. It‚Äôs has been a while. I think that‚Äôs enough for today.
Raine: A-already?!
Raine: But‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt managed to change back to human yet!
Raine: I thought we were going to keep going until-
Roselyn: You aren‚Äôt going to master shapeshifting in one afternoon. And I have many other duties I must attend to‚Ä¶
Roselyn: ‚Ä¶such as mending the damage you‚Äôve done to these curtains. We can try again another day.
Roselyn: Speaking of which‚Ä¶ That top of yours‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs made from a torn up sweater, am I correct? Hand it over. I‚Äôll mend that as well, when I have the time.
Raine: Oh, yeah, some of it was used for bandages back when I was- Wait‚Ä¶!
TWITCHRed: R-Raine?
Raine: Aah! No! My hands-!
Raine: Rose! Rose, take it back!
Rose: Back? Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll make sure your top gets back to you good as new.
Raine: No, that‚Äôs not- ah!
TWITCH!
Raine: B-bad hands! Let go of that!
Raine: Eep!
SLIP!
Raine: Oh no! Come on! Ngh‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ have to stop myself! I won‚Äôt do it!
FSSH!
BZZT!
Rose: (thoughts) Good‚Ä¶
Raine: I‚Ä¶ am‚Ä¶ in control!
CRICK!
Raine: Ngh-!
SNAP!BOOM!
Red: ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm okay!
Raine: Eh?
Raine: My hands? I‚Ä¶ I did it?
Raine: I did it!
FLUMP
Raine: Whoops! Hehheh‚Ä¶
Rose: You‚Ä¶ did. Well done, Raine.
Rose: (thoughts) _‚Ä¶She was only supposed to change back. I picked this collar to give her no other option, but‚Ä¶ She broke it. A collar enchanted by Trace himself.Raine: Thank you, Ms Roselyn. Although that was a pretty mean trick.
Roselyn: Desperation can be a good motivator.
Roselyn: And little embarrassment never killed anyone.
Roselyn: But for what it‚Äôs worth, if you‚Äôd failed‚Ä¶ I could have wiped his memory of it.
Red: What?! You‚Äôre bluffing!
Roselyn: Then again, it does sometimes damage the mind, and it doesn‚Äôt seem like he has much mind to spare.
Red: Hey!
Roselyn: Anyway, I was serious when I said it‚Äôs going to take more than one lesson to master your gift. But you have‚Ä¶ potential. How would you feel about me teaching you magic?
Raine: Teach me? Like‚Ä¶ as your student? ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs not going to be as intense as this every time, is it?
Roselyn: No, no. We‚Äôd start from the ground up. The basics. Just a few lessons, while you‚Äôre staying here.
Raine: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like that. I‚Äôd like that a lot! I‚Äôve always wanted formal magic training, outside of books.
Roselyn: Good. We‚Äôll start tomorrow, then. But for now, go on. Have fun with your friends. I have work to do.
Raine: O-okay! Thank you so much again, Ms Roselyn!
Roselyn: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶Potential, indeed.Trace: So, this must be the place.
Trace: ‚Ä¶Huh‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs turning cold outside, but in here it‚Äôs like summer! Cool!
THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
Trace: But where‚Äôs- Oh no.
THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
Flora: Grawr!
Trace: Blarg!
Flora: Hi.
Trace: Flora. Don‚Äôt you think you should take it a little easier?
Flora: Why? Just cause I‚Äôm carrying a baby? Tigress mothers stay active right up until we‚Äôre due! We‚Äôre not delicate like you humans.
Trace: Hrmph.
Flora: (in Keidran) Oh, hey! Keith, Natani! you guys made it as well! ‚Ä¶Uh‚Ä¶ Everything alright with you two?
Keith: (in Keidran) O-oh, yeah! W‚Äôre fine.
Natani: (in Keidran) Yes! Fine.
Zen: (thoughts) Have fun with your friends out there, Natani. I‚Äôll enjoy the sun and sand vicariously.
Zen: (thoughts) Just don‚Äôt start having too much fun with that Basitin before warning me, okay?
Natani: (thoughts) You shut it, Zen!Kathrin: (in Keidran) Hey! Guess who brought lunch? (It‚Äôs me!)
Zen: (in Keidran) Oh, Kat! You don‚Äôt have to do that. You should be down at the party with the others.
Kathrin: (in Keidran) I will, later, but I wanted to do this first.
Kathrin: (in Keidran) Natani and Keith left already?
Zen: (in Keidran) Yeah, but it‚Äôs fine. With a mental link, we‚Äôre never really apart. And‚Ä¶ they‚Äôve got their own stuff going on now.
Zen: (in Keidran) You know‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs funny. This isn‚Äôt exactly how I pictured our reunion. I thought things would kind of just‚Ä¶ go back to the way they were. The Assassin Brothers, together again!
Zen: (in Keidran) But seeing them together, it‚Äôs started dawning on me that‚Ä¶ Natani‚Äôs been building a new life. And I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ not really part of it anymore.
Kathrin: (in Keidran) Don‚Äôt say that. Things are going to change, it‚Äôs a part of life‚Ä¶ But you‚Äôll always be family.
Kathrin: (in Keidran) Keith‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a part of your pack now too!
Zen: (in Keidran) Our pack, huh? Hm‚Ä¶ Never thought I‚Äôd have one of those. Never in a million years thought it‚Äôd be Natani to start one before me.Red: Yo!
Red: We made it! And it looks like everyone else did too. Sorry for the wait.
Maren: Well, you didn‚Äôt miss anything.
Maren: We haven‚Äôt started mingling yet. Honestly‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not really sure how to interact with any of Trace‚Äôs new‚Ä¶ friends.
Maren: You were right though, this place really is a zoo.
Red: Wow, no kidding.
Red: It‚Äôs almost like Trace went out of his way to collect one of every breed of fleab‚Äì
Red: Er‚Ä¶ f‚Ä¶ furred‚Ä¶ folk!
Red: But, you know. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ whatever.
Maren: (Thoughts) ‚Ä¶Did sword-for- brains just‚Ä¶ think before talking for once? I don‚Äôt even know how to react to that.
Maren: (Thoughts) Trace dating a Keidran is one thing, but this‚Ä¶ This is truly a sign of the apocalypse.Maren: Seems like everyone‚Äôs here. I‚Äôm gunna go find a drink.
Karen: Hang on! Reni‚Äôs not back yet!
Reni: Erm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm here.
Karen: Huh? Wha‚Äî ‚Ä¶Reni?
Reni: H-hi‚Ä¶
Reni: This‚Ä¶ is the current version of my human form. 
It‚Äôs still a work in progress!
Karen: Woah, that‚Äôs so cool!
I thought dragons could only turn into animals?
Reni: We can be human, though it‚Äôs hard not to look off in some way.
Most just don‚Äôt out of pride. I think‚Äî eh?!
POKE! POKE!
Karen: You forgot two things.
Maren: Karen! Boundaries!
Reni: Oh, yeah‚Ä¶
Reni: Well, I did consider other sizes in the past, but I‚Äôm not a mammal, so I could never tell if I got them right.
Besides, being on two legs is strange enough without being top-heavy too.Keith: (in Keidran) Natani? You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ Are you okay being like that?
Natani: (in Keidran) Well, it‚Äôs too hot for a sweater in this place! And‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ want to be here with everyone. I‚Äôve never been able to do stuff like this before. Ngh‚Ä¶ so, I guess I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ seeing how this goes‚Ä¶
Flora: (in Keidran) Hey Natani! What‚Äôs up with the wrapped chest?
Natani: Huh?
Natani: (in Keidran) Wait, you‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know?
Flora: (in Keidran) Know what?
Keith: (in Keidran) F-Flora, leave it-!
Natani: (in Keidran) No, it‚Äôs okay, Keith. She‚Äôs going to find out eventually. I‚Äôd rather it came from me first.
Flora: (in Keidran) Hm? Wait‚Ä¶ what?!
Flora: (in Keidran) You‚Ä¶ Huh?!
Flora: (in Keidran) Really?
Flora: (in Keidran) Wow. So, under there‚Ä¶ huh‚Ä¶
Flora: (in Keidran) Well, they can‚Äôt possibly be very big if you can hide them so well like that! And that means, with Reni, there‚Äôs now two people here with breasts smaller than mine! Sure it‚Äôs a guy and a dragon, but I‚Äôll take it! Victory!
Keith: (in Keidran) ‚Ä¶Seriously, Flora? That‚Äôs what you think of first?
Natani: (in Keidran) I‚Äôm find with this! Don‚Äôt correct her!Karen: Alright, enough with the yappin‚Äô! We‚Äôre all here! It‚Äôs time to party!

Maren: Where in the world did you get this from?
Sythe: Magic table. It reminded me of the first night we met. Remember?
Maren: Oh! Yeah‚Ä¶
Hey! Ugh! Don‚Äôt eat in the pool! That‚Äôs filthy!
Sythe: Eh, so what? Being filthy can be fun sometimes. Come on, it‚Äôs a party.
SPLASH!
Maren: Mmm‚Ä¶
Maren: ‚Ä¶Nom
Sythe: Hey, Maren.
Maren: Hm?
Sythe: ‚Ä¶What do you say the two of us head back to the rooms and hook up, right now.
Maren: GULK!Maren: What?! Don‚Äôt make jokes like that!
Sythe: I‚Äôm not joking. Why not?
Maren: Why not?! Because you‚Äôre a wolf, idiot!
Maren: We‚Äôre different species!
Sythe: So? Doesn‚Äôt seem to have stopped our ex‚Äôs any.
Sythe: And if it‚Äôs good enough for the Grand Templar‚Ä¶
Maren: No, no, no! The whole world might be turning upside down, but I‚Äôm not going along with it!
Sythe: Okay! Okay! Fair enough.
Sythe: If you don‚Äôt want it, that‚Äôs fine!
Maren: Why would you even want a relationship? Aren‚Äôt humans‚Ä¶ disgusting to you?
Sythe: Oh, come on, Maren. Fur or not, you‚Äôre anything but disgusting. And it wouldn‚Äôt be something so serious as a relationship. Just a way to, you know, feel things out. Satisfy curiosity.
Sythe: I thought you might be curious too, but maybe not. It‚Äôs cool. Don‚Äôt worry about it.
Maren: ‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶ I need to get a drink.
Sythe: Oh, okay, sure. There‚Äôs a table down by the beach.
Maren: ‚Ä¶Is there one in your room?Caption: **Meanwhile‚Ä¶ **
Brutus: Ah-hah! Gotcha!
Roan: BAWK! BAWK! BAWK!
Brutus: BE-KAW!!
Brutus: CHOMP!
Roan: Yeeeeoow!!
Brutus: Mmfff? Templar?
Roan: It‚Äôs me, Roan, you stupid idiot!
Brutus: ‚Ä¶Why were you a chicken, Roan?
Roan: Me and Sam were caught by the estate security looking for a way to break you out! So thanks for trying to eat me, you moron!
Brutus: Oh‚Ä¶ sorry. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre okay. Uh‚Ä¶
Brutus: Say‚Ä¶ just asking, but‚Ä¶ are you going to eat that egg? Or‚Ä¶ ?Sythe: There‚Äôs the table. Just ask it for whatever you want and it appears! If they have it.
Maren: Huh‚Ä¶ handy. Could have used this at my tavern.
Maren: (Thoughts) Gods‚Ä¶ am I really actually considering this? He said it wouldn‚Äôt be serious, so it doesn‚Äôt have to mean anything.
Maren: (Thoughts) But still! He‚Äôs a Keidran! Am I crazy?
Sythe: Maren, not to shoot myself in the foot, but I told you, it‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre uncomfortable. I know humans don‚Äôt go this fast.
Sythe: We can just take it easy.
Maren: Ngh‚Ä¶ Tell me, Wolfboy! Just how different are you from a human?
Sythe: Uh‚Ä¶ huh? In what regard?
Maren: You know what I mean! How do you‚Ä¶ compare?
Sythe: Um, I‚Äôm not really sure? But‚Ä¶ I mean, I‚Äôm not wearing any pants right now‚Ä¶
Sythe: So‚Ä¶
Maren: Drinks! Yes! Need drinks!Maren: Table! I order you to make me a red wine‚Ä¶ er, actually make that whiskey‚Ä¶ a whole bottle!
Maren: ‚Ä¶Hello?
Sythe: You actually have to put your hand on it first.
Maren: Oh.
Maren: Okay? Whiskey!

Maren: Uh‚Ä¶
Maren: Did I do it wrong?
Maren: Ah! Is that supposed to be happening?
Sythe: Huh?!Reni: Trace!
Trace: Oh! Hey, Reni! Everything alright?
Reni: Yes! Very much so!
Reni: I just wanted to thank you for allowing me intrude on your gathering.
Trace: Of course! It‚Äôs no intrusion. You‚Äôre welcome here.
Reni: T-thanks!
Reni: As a dragon living among humans, it‚Äôs often hard to feel‚Ä¶ normal, but everyone here is so‚Ä¶ different! For the first time in my life, I don‚Äôt feel like I stand out much.
Flora: Mrow!
Reni: This is‚Ä¶ a very odd but remarkable group of friends you have.
Trace: Yeah. I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôve managed to finally all gather in one place. Without a fight breaking out, anyway. Speaking of which, I actually want to say something while most are still here‚Ä¶
Trace: Could I interrupt everyone for a sec?
Red: Hm?
THUMP!
Red: Hey! Not fair!Trace: I know many of us will be going our separate ways soon enough. Some of you are headed home‚Ä¶ and others are continuing on with us.
Trace: But we‚Äôre all here together now. And while we are‚Ä¶
Trace: There‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôd like to do, before we get scattered again‚Ä¶
Trace: Flora‚Ä¶
Flora: Yes, Trace?
Trace: Let‚Äôs get married!
Flora: GEH!
Red: What?!
Flora: Trace! That‚Äôs not the way you‚Äôre supposed to ask that!
Trace: ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs not?Trace: Oh? Oh!
Trace: S-sorry, I didn‚Äôt know there was a procedure!
Trace: I don‚Äôt have anything to give, or‚Äî
Flora: It‚Äôs okay, Trace. You already did. Just ask me the question.
Trace: O-ok! Flora‚Ä¶ will you marry me?
Flora: Yes.
Flora: Yes I will.
Karen: Aaaaww!
Red: What?! No no no! This is crazy! Fooling around is one thing, but‚Ä¶ marriage?! Y-you can‚Äôt do that!
Reni: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure how to react. A part of me wishes non-humans could be more open with humans‚Ä¶ (Not me! I - I mean others‚Ä¶)
Reni: But with the war, marrying a Keidran‚Ä¶
Trace: I know it won‚Äôt be accepted. I don‚Äôt care. We can have it here on the estate in private, but I want it to be done, for real. And I really hope you‚Äôll all be willing to‚Äî

Flora: Yeah, I think so.
Flora: I saw you teleport away. I grabbed on just in the time.
Trace: Where are we? It looks like we ended up in a hallway.
Flora: That‚Äôs weird. I wonder if I messed up where it was trying to send you.

Trace: ‚Ä¶Understand?
Flora: Eh-heh‚Ä¶ Hello‚Ä¶
LICK!
Flora: Ack!Nora: (thoughts) You want what?
Trace: Dragons! Made of stone, for protection. Think of it!
Nora: (thoughts) Absolutely not!
Trace: Nora‚Ä¶
Nora: (thoughts) No. Caricatures of dragons acting as your personal guard dogs? It‚Äôs insulting! And a waste of my magic.
Trace: It‚Äôs not for me! It‚Äôs for her. I made a few attempts myself, but they just don‚Äôt have the spark of life you could give it.
Trace: Nora‚Ä¶ please?
Nora: (thoughts) Rawgh! I‚Ä¶ suppose I could make you‚Ä¶ A lizard. Not a dragon!
Nora: (thoughts) And just the one! You want more, you‚Äôre on your own. This counts as my gift for the birthday.
Trace: Thank you, Nora.
Nora: (thoughts) You take advantage of me, you know that, right?
Trace: You say that like you don‚Äôt want me to.
Nora: (thoughts) Snrk! Cheeky. Just don‚Äôt push it, little one.
Flora: Trace, it‚Äôs following us. Are you sure this thing is safe?
Trace: Yeah, I‚Äôm sure. I remember‚Ä¶ Nora made him for me. Stoneward.

Flora: Plech! It‚Äôs dusty in here!
Trace: Darn, I was hoping for a way out‚Ä¶
Trace: Well, we‚Äôre still in the manor. It looks like we‚Äôre on the 3rd floor. I think I see a big glass domed room next to us. That must be where the fancy gold door in the hall goes.
Trace: It‚Äôs the only option, so it must be the way back.
Trace: Flora? Find something?
Flora: Nah, just some old junk. Although‚Ä¶ this is weird.
Flora: A crib? What‚Äôs something like this doing here?
Flora: ‚Ä¶Trace?CRCK!

Trace: The memories‚Ä¶ they came back so strongly this time. But I‚Äôm okay. I don‚Äôt feel the other part of me trying to get out this time. I think even he would rather not be here.Trace: Eh?
Trace: What‚Äôs this for?
Flora: To make you feel better. And remind you that your fiancee is one of those ‚Äúfilthy Keidran‚Äù now.
Trace: Well‚Ä¶ you do shed quite a bit.
Flora: Hey!
Flora: Oh‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace, it‚Äôs still watching.
WOOSH!
Trace: Huh? Oh, yeah, it‚Äôs fine.
Trace: You know, he was meant to be for her.
Flora: You‚Ä¶ had Nora make your child a giant, scary stone lizard?
Trace: Yeah. I figured, why not? I had Nora growing up. I planned for Stoney to be her version of Nora. An eternal companion. But‚Ä¶

Keith: (in Keidran) Can you teleport us out?
Natani: (in Keidran) First thing I tried, but I‚Äôm blocked.

Red: Didn‚Äôt you hear what Raine said? You could have hit her, you idiot!
Keith: Natani doesn‚Äôt know human!
Natani: (In Keidran) I know what ‚Äúidiot‚Äù means! You got something to say, Red?!
Raine: Uh‚Ä¶ guys?!
Raine: The moment you chipped that wall, every statue turned to look our way! I think we‚Äôve got their attention!
Natani: (In Keidran) Hey! That‚Äôs the one I killed!
Red: Shit! Well, just means we‚Äôre on the right track.
Red: We‚Äôll smash any that get past the dragon and take out this wall together.
Natani: (In Keidran) Yes.
Natani: To-geh-ter.

Trace: I‚Äôm alright. Don‚Äôt worry.
Flora: Oh! I didn‚Äôt notice this painting here before. It‚Äôs another of Miss Roselyn, like the one in the foyer.
Trace: Ah, yeah. Saria‚Äôs work again.
Flora: It seems like she enjoyed painting Rose a lot. They must have been good friends. Saria‚Äôs death had to have been devastating to her as well.
Flora: I wonder if Rose was planning to be the nanny, had Saria lived?
Trace: I don‚Äôt remember, but‚Ä¶ yeah, probably. She acts like a stern old wolf now, but somehow I get the feeling back then she‚Äôd have been just as excited.
Trace: SIGH
Trace: Come on, we should get out of here.
Trace: I don‚Äôt like this place. Too many old‚Ä¶Trace: Hang on. Something‚Äôs not right.
Flora: What‚Äôs the matter, Trace?
Trace: Look at the dust. Everything in this room hasn‚Äôt been touched in years. But it almost looks like someone set this painting down here recently.
Flora: Huh? You‚Äôre right. It was probably on a wall somewhere before, like the others.
Flora: It must have been Rose who moved it. But‚Ä¶ why would she take a painting of herself off a wall and hide it in here? Unless‚Ä¶
Flora: A-AH!

Karen: But neither were you‚Ä¶ If the estate is making illusions to trick us, how do I know you‚Äôre not a trick too?
Karen: Quick! Tell me something only I would know!
Madelyn: Huh-? I just met you today. And if the house really is out to get us, it could have overheard anything I told you.
Karen: Oh, right‚Ä¶
Karen: Quick! Tell me something I wouldn‚Äôt know!
Madelyn: Wha-?
Madelyn: Then how would you know if it‚Äôs true or not you idiot!
Madelyn: Listen, I just snuck in earlier, okaaay? I‚Äôm a spy, it‚Äôs what I do.

Madelyn: ‚Ä¶f-from a distance.Karen: So where‚Äôs the real Maren?
Madelyn: I saw her leave the oasis with that wolf guy a while ago.
Karen: Oh! She‚Äôs missing this. At least she‚Äôs out of danger, then.
Karen: Wait, wolf guy? Sythe‚Ä¶ with Maren? Where‚Äôd they go?
Madelyn: They said they were headed to the rooms. Mentioned something about a ‚Äúhook up‚Äù‚Ä¶ whatever that means.
Karen: WHAT?! They really said that? Are you absolutely sure?!
Madelyn: Eep! Y-yes? Why?
Karen: Oh my gosh‚Ä¶ this is the best day of my life.

Romulus: Boss, one of us should go with you!
Clovis: I‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôll have my right- hand wolf soon, after all.
Clovis: Now do as I say. And give Zenny my regards.
Romulus: ‚Ä¶You get the feeling the boss wouldn‚Äôt bother with this himself if it was us instead of Brutus down there?

Remus: I was just gunna gut ‚Äòem real quick.
Romulus: You heard Clovis, he‚Äôs not the target! Come on, let‚Äôs just grab Zen and go!
Remus: You go, It‚Äôll only take me a minute.
Remus: He couldn‚Äôt have gone far.
Sythe: Ngh‚Ä¶Detritus: It‚Äôs been so long, but we can finally proceed.
Trace: Who‚Äôs there?! What are you doing with Maren?
Trace: What‚Äôs happened to Rose?!
Detritus: ‚Ä¶I do not understand these questions. As I said, the body is prepared. Rose is as she ever was, since being made the heart of the estate.
Detritus: You set me to awaken in the event that Rose should ever break free from her restrictions. I have activated the guardians to ensure nothing interrupts the ritual.
Trace: I‚Ä¶ you what?! Whatever this is, it needs to stop! Who are you?!
Detritus: . . . So, it‚Äôs true. Our memories have been tampered with.
Detritus: ‚Ä¶No matter. I was another experiment of ours. A contingency. One‚Ä¶ not quite successful.
Detritus: You called me Detritus.Detritus:Now, I must attend to Saria‚Äôs new body.
Trace: Saria‚Äôs‚Ä¶?! Are you saying‚Ä¶ The only reason I dated Maren was for‚Ä¶ this?
Detritus: She was one of several candidates. We searched so long for the right match.
Detritus: A beautiful woman. A face much like hers. But this girl‚Ä¶ such an impudent personality.
Detritus: An obnoxious tavern wench from a tiny village. No one would miss her. It was perfect. You left to go retrieve her, but then‚Ä¶ you disappeared. And I slept. But no matter, she‚Äôs here now.
Trace: This is insane! Stealing other people‚Äôs bodies‚Ä¶ was this really how twisted I became? It doesn‚Äôt matter. This has to stop! Hear me? This isn‚Äôt what I want anymore! I order you to stop!
Detritus: . . . . .Detritus: The three of us had a pact: to see Saria alive again. We sacrificed for this. All of us.
Detritus: ‚Ä¶You are not Trace. You‚Äôre no longer even a shadow of him, as I am. He once called me a failure. ‚ÄúToo dangerous.‚Äù He questioned whether a monster imbued with  is own mind could ever truly stay loyal. How ironic.
Detritus: Now it seems I am the only one willing to continue with the plan. Trace would never abandon Saria! I will never abandon Saria!
Detritus: I am more worthy of the name Trace than you!

Red: Raine, I appreciate you‚Äôre trying to help, but that was a rhetorical question!Raine: No, wait! The ceiling! It‚Äôs flat, but it has no columns. It‚Äôs probably held up by supports from the roof above. If so, there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs as thick and heavy as these walls. At least I‚Ä¶ I think‚Ä¶
Raine: Look! There! That‚Äôs not a star!
Raine: It‚Äôs a hole! That must be from when Natani‚Äôs magic got deflected!
Reni: !
Old Guardian: GRR-ACK!
SLAM!
FLUMP
SHOOF!Reni: GROAAAAAAR!
FWOOM!
CRASH! CRASH!
Raine: She did it! She‚Äôs out!
Raine: Wait, look, the walls!Raine: We must have caused enough damage to knock out the whole room‚Äôs magic. Huh? What‚Äôs happening‚Ä¶
Raine: What?! They were fake too?!
FWEW!
Raine: Well some had to be real, there‚Äôs still pieces everywhere. Either they just teleported away, or the room was making it seem like there were way more than there were.
Raine: It would explain how they seemed endless. Oh, the doors back!
Red: Ack! And the wall‚Äôs gone! Was everything in the room a lie?!
Karen: Oh, yeah‚Ä¶ the room was using illusions against us, I probably should have mentioned that earlier‚Ä¶ my bad.
Raine: Strange‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve often been able to see through illusions, but this time I couldn‚Äôt tell. Everything in here was lit up like magic.
Red: Raine! Tail!
Raine: Hm‚Ä¶? Ack!
Reni: URRGH‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) Everyone okay down there?Reni: (thoughts) Stick together, get to a safe location, and stay down. I must go check on the grounds and the dungeons!
Raine: Reni, you‚Äôre hurt! And you must be exhausted! You should rest yourself first!
Reni: (thoughts) Afterwards! For now, I must fulfill my duties! I‚Äôll be fine. I am a dragon.
Reni: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm honestly more concerned about walking around outside without any clothes on. Ack! I‚Äôm streaking!
Reni: (thoughts) ‚Ä¶At least no one can see me.
Saeleen: Woah! Did you see that, Landy?! Reni‚Äôs attacking the Grand Templar‚Äôs house! And she‚Äôs naked!
Landy: Sealeen‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs a dragon. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not weird.
Saeleen: I know! I‚Äôve just never seen her without her regalia. I bet Sarah would‚Äôve loved this.RUMBLE RUMBLE RUMBLE
Roan: D-did you hear that? It‚Äôs the dragon, I know it! Argh, we‚Äôre so screwed!
Brutus: Don‚Äôt worry! The boss‚Äôll get us out, you‚Äôll see!
Roan: You moron! The boss doesn‚Äôt care about me or you! Clovis doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself. ‚Ä¶And that weird vendetta against those two assassins, for some reason.
Brutus: That‚Äôs not true. He sent you to get me out.
Roan: He didn‚Äôt send us! Sam and I only tried to get you out ‚Äòcaused we figured there‚Äôd be extra coin in it. We knew you were the boss‚Äôs favorite tool.
Roan: But he‚Äôs not coming back for us. That pompous prick would sooner let us all die than risk his own powdered ass!
Clovis: Well, it‚Äôs good to know how you really feel, Roan.
Roan: Ah! C-Clovis?!
Brutus: Boss!Brutus: H-hey boss‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm glad to see you too.
Clovis: Brutus‚Ä¶ Why are you looking at me like that? There‚Äôs no need for you to be scared.
Clovis: I know how you feel about being burned. It‚Äôs a painful way to go. I would never kill you that way.
Brutus: Oh! That‚Äôs a  relief!
Clovis: You don‚Äôt look injured.
Brutus: No! I‚Äôm fine!
Clovis: When that dragon hit you and you fell from the wall, I assumed you‚Äôd been killed. I was sad‚Ä¶ but I had my amulet. I told myself
it was meant to be. A tidy end to a rotten era.
Clovis: But then I learned you were alive, and‚Ä¶ despite the amulet, my very first thought was getting you out. It made me
realize just how much I‚Äôd come to value you. To the point where I‚Äôd even consider risking my own‚Ä¶ substantially more valuable self.
Brutus: ‚Ä¶Boss?
Clovis: Brutus‚Ä¶You‚Äôve always been my most loyal friend. A weakness I‚Äôve allowed myself to tolerate.Brutus: Aw, Boss! You‚Äôve always been my best friend! The others said you don‚Äôt care, but I always knew it!
Clovis: ‚Ä¶You were right. I do.
Brutus: Oh, that‚Äôs funny‚Ä¶ I feel freally tired all of the sudden‚Ä¶
Clovis: Don‚Äôt mind it, Brutus.
Clovis: You‚Äôve been through a lot. Rest now.
Brutus: Oh, can we get something to eat once we get back? We can celebrate your success! I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ starving‚Ä¶
Brutus: I can‚Äôt wait‚Ä¶ to get back home. I never doubted you‚Äôd come back for me. I‚Ä¶ Clovis‚Ä¶
Brutus: Clovis‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Clovis: ‚Ä¶Goodbye, Brutus.Remus: (in Keidran) Come out! I can smell you behind that curtain. You‚Äôre injured. Show yourself and I‚Äôll make it quick.
Remus: (in Keidran) If you run, I will catch you, and I will make it hurt. Don‚Äôt force me to‚Äî
Mrs Nibbly: GRRRRRRRRRR!
Remus: Huh?
Sythe: Wha-? Nibs?!
Mrs Nibbly: GRRRRRRRRRRRR
Remus: (in Keidran) The hell? I‚Äôve never heard a squirrel growling like that before‚Ä¶ Shoo, ya little rat!Remus: (in Keidran) This a pet of yours?
Remus: (in Keidran) I‚Äôd blast it, but it‚Äôd just be a waste of magic to‚Äî ah! Hey!
Remus: (in Keidran) What‚Äôs wrong with this thing? Doesn‚Äôt it have any survival instinct at all?
Remus: (in Keidran) Get off of me! Get‚Äî
CHOMP!
Remus: Whimper‚Ä¶Remus: AGH!
Remus: Ow! Ow! What the hell get out of‚Äî Ah! Argh!
Remus: Get‚Ä¶ OFF!
FLUMPH!
Remus: You‚Ä¶! Ngh!
Remus: I‚Äôll burn you to ash for this, you little‚Äî!
Remus: Ah!?
Remus: My mana! How did it know to‚Ä¶?
Mrs Nibbly: CHITTER
Remus: Urgh‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre no ordinary squirrel. What are you? A familiar?
Remus: Think you‚Äôre a clever little shit, don‚Äôt you!?Remus: (in Keidran) Well guess what‚Ä¶?
Remus: (in Keidran) You‚Äôre not as clever as you think you are!
FWOSH!
Sythe: Nibs!
BOOM!
Sythe: Argh!
Remus: (in Keidran) What kind of amateur do you take me for?!
Sythe: Urgh‚Ä¶
Remus: (in Keidran) You think there‚Äôs anyone in the guild who doesn‚Äôt hide mana in case of an emergency?
Remus: (in Keidran) Agh! That stupid rat! A quicker death than it deserved‚Ä¶
Remus: (in Keidran) But you‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to pay for what it did to me! I‚Äôm going to‚Äì!
Remus: ‚Ä¶?Remus: Ah?!
Remus: What the hell?! What is tha‚Äï!
THUD!
Remus: Ergh!
CRACK!
Remus: AAAAAAAAAAAH!
Sythe: Ngh‚Ä¶Sythe: Nib‚Ä¶bly?
BLINK
Nibbly: Squeak?
Sythe: Oh, hey, there you are, beautiful. For a sec, you looked‚Ä¶ well, I must have hit my head harder than I thought.
BOOP
Sythe: Heh, yeah, yeah, I‚Äôm okay. I‚Äôm glad you are too. Thank goodness his aim was as lousy as he was clumsy. Still, you‚Äôre one oddly tenacious squirrel‚Ä¶ I feel like I should be questioning this more‚Ä¶ but I also feel like I might have a concussion right now.Sythe: We better get out of here, in case that guy isn‚Äôt as dead as he seems!
Sythe: The other one said the name ‚ÄúClovis.‚Äù
Sythe: That means it‚Äôs the same group as that fox that attacked us on the road. But he got blasted. How did they catch up with us? Ugh‚Ä¶
Sythe: I‚Äôm in no shape to fight. I have to go warn the others. But what I really need is to find Maren. Why did she vanish? Is it related to all this?
Sythe: Huh? Hey, Nibs! Where you going? Don‚Äôt run off!
Sythe: Upstairs? I guess it‚Äôs the safest direction. Wait, are you‚Ä¶ taking me somewhere?
Nibbly: Squeak squeak!
Sythe: Welp, that settles it. I definitely have brain damage. Danger all around, and I‚Äôm following a squirrel.Clovis: You‚Äôre a big wolf, but even this should be enough. At least I could ensure with this poison, there‚Äôs no pain.
Clovis: ‚Ä¶It had to be done. You were only meant to be a pawn. Someone I could use for my own gain. Nothing more.
Young Clovis: Heh Heh!
Clovis: Nothing!
SMASH!
Clovis: Ah?!
Reni: ROAR!*Clovis:** Urgh!
SLAM!
Clovis: Dragons‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs always dragons‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) So you‚Äôre the one behind these attacks! I recognize you from the memories. Surrender, now!
Clovis: You Insufferable, self-righteous creature!
Clovis: You and your kind have been the bane of my existence! Interfering with my plans! With my life!
Reni: ROOAAR!
Clovis: But not this time!Kathrin: I know Rose said we didn‚Äôt have to‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôd feel bad leaving all this work for her.\
Kathrin: Sigh‚Ä¶ Not sure if I can get this blood out, though‚Ä¶
Kathrin: I‚Äôm worried about Zen. He puts on an act, but his infection is getting worse. He‚Äôs got to stop sneaking out of bed and reopening the wounds. He needs to take it easy.
RUMBLE RUMBLE RUMBLE
Kathrin: Huh? What was that? I wonder if Natani and the others are training.
Kathrin: They should take it easy too! Natani just recovered. Tsk, those two really are siblings.
Romulus: Excuse me.
Romulus: I‚Äôm sorry, it seems I‚Äôm a bit lost. Could you please direct me to Zen‚Äôs room?
Romulus: The name‚Äôs Romulus, by the way.Kathrin: Are‚Ä¶ are you a friend of his?
Romulus: Oh yeah, we‚Äôre real good friends. I‚Äôve brought a gift for him, in fact. Now where is he?
Kathrin: I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know where Zen is‚Ä¶
Romulus: Don‚Äôt lie to me. It‚Äôs my day job to sense lies.
Romulus: SNFF SNFF
Romulus: I know he‚Äôs here. I can smell the scent of a wolf on you‚Ä¶ Male‚Ä¶ injured?
Romulus: Last chance. Look me in the eyes and tell me where he is. Truthfully.
Romulus: If you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll just track him down by scent eventually, and your friends will have to find you lying here.Romulus: Well? Nothing? Shame. I don‚Äôt take any joy in killing innocent girls‚Ä¶
Romulus: But I have a job to do, and I just don‚Äôt have time to‚Äì
Kathrin: Steak!
Romulus: ‚Äìto‚Ä¶ what?
Romulus: Steak?
POP!
CLINK!
Romulus: What the‚Äî?!
SHINK!
Romulus: AUGH!Kathrin: Help!
Kathrin: There‚Äôs someone here! Help!
CLINK!
Romulus: Not so fast!
Kathrin: No! Let go! Let‚Äì!
Romulus: Quiet!
Romulus: There‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs better. I gotta admit‚Ä¶ I dunno how you did that, but you really got me! Nice one!
Romulus: But enough games. Let‚Äôs try this again: Tell me exactly where Zen is. Now.
Kathrin: Zen‚Ä¶ Zen isn‚Äôt in this hall, he‚Äôs in the next wing, f-first door on the left‚Ä¶
Romulus: Good girl.
Kathrin: Huh? W-why‚Äì?
Romulus: This was supposed to be my gift for Zen. But if he‚Äôs so injured, I doubt he‚Äôll put up much of a fight, anyway.
Romulus: And I have a feeling the boss will like you.Romulus: Don‚Äôt bother trying to take it off. Not even I can.
Romulus: You‚Äôre property of Clovis now.
Kathrin: No‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt belong to anyone!
Romulus: Hey, I said no lying. Someone clearly put a lot of work into you.
Romulus: It‚Äôs obvious just from the way you look what you are.
Romulus: Now, be a good girl and head over to the terrace. The estate is still warded, but once you‚Äôre outside, it‚Äôll send you to some friends of mine.
Kathrin: N-n‚Ä¶ O-okay.
Romulus: Keep up that spirit, though. Maybe one day you‚Äôll get Clovis like you did me!
Romulus: HA HA
Romulus: If so, word of advice‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre gunna get the drop on someone‚Ä¶
Romulus: Maybe try and make sure you hit something more vital next time?
Romulus: Ugh‚Äí!
Zen: Noted.
Romulus: Z-Zen‚Ä¶!Romulus: Heh‚Ä¶ damn‚Ä¶ ugh‚Ä¶
THUD
Kathrin: Help‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt control‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶
Kathrin: I need to‚Ä¶
Zen: Kat! It‚Äôs me! I got you!
Kathrin: No! Let me go! I need to‚Ä¶ leave!
Zen: Relax! I know you‚Äôre not yourself right now!
Zen: Hey! I need some help over here!
SCRATCH!
Zen: Eurgh!
Zen: I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ not‚Ä¶ letting‚Ä¶ go!
KAT
Kathrin: Ah?Kathrin: It‚Ä¶ it stopped‚Ä¶ W-what happened?
Eric: HUFF HUFF
Eric: PHEW
Kathrin: Eric!
Eric: Kat, are you alright? I ran when I heard your screaming.
Kathrin: It was so scary! It was like‚Ä¶ something else in my head, pulling my strings!
Eric: I know. I never wanted you to have to experience one of those things. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ unfortunately very familiar with them given my‚Ä¶ family‚Äôs occupation. I just cycled through every failsafe I knew. If it wasn‚Äôt for Zen‚Ä¶
Kathrin: Oh! Zen! Are you hurt?
Zen: What, me? Pfff, nah! I‚Äôm just glad I got to finally stick it to Remus. Or‚Ä¶ was it Rom?
Zen: I could never tell them ap- urgh!
Kathrin: Thank you!
Zen: Oh! Ngh, no problem!Natani: Zen! Are you there? I felt more pain, what happened? Did you run into the lizard rocks too?
Zen: Natani!
Zen: No, I‚Äôm fine, I just‚Ä¶ uh, did you just say lizard rocks?
Natani: Yeah, the beach party got a little more exciting than expected. We were attacked.
Zen: What?! Why didn‚Äôt you contact me?!
Natani: I couldn‚Äôt! Until I stepped out of the room, I couldn‚Äôt reach you at all.
Natani: It‚Äôll be faster if we just traded memories. I‚Äôm fine, though.
Natani: Just overexerted myself a bit with magic protecting Keith.
Keith: Hey!
Natani: We‚Äôre headed to the foyer to regroup.
Zen: Okay, but be careful! I ran into another of Clovis‚Äô goons up here. One of the twins. There may be more.
Natani: Uh‚Ä¶
Natani: I‚Ä¶ think I found the other one. Guess the dragon must have got to him first. She did run ahead to check things out.
Karen: Dead body!Sythe: Uh‚Ä¶ Hey, Nibs, slow down a little, would ya?
Sythe: Is the house rumbling‚Ä¶?
Mrs Nibbly: SNIFF SNIFF
SWOOP!
Sythe: What the hell?! Nibs!
Sythe: How did you‚Ä¶ huh?
Sythe: ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs a hallway! Why did I think it was a wall a second ago?
ROAAAR!
Sythe: And now suddenly I wish it still was.
Sythe: ‚Ä¶Also wish I‚Äôd grabbed some pants first.Flora: Trace! What are we going to do?!
Trace: I don‚Äôt know! Stay behind me, I‚Äôll think of something!
Guardian: ROAR!!
Detritus: Malfunctioning creature. Why do you not obey me?
Guardian: Wark!
Detritus: I have taken over all security functions of the estate.
Detritus: You were designed to obey, like the other guardians. To serve the will of the estate.
Detritus: I am that will. Now do what you were designed for and serve me.
SMASH!
Detritus: Grah!
Trace: That‚Äôs not going to happen!
Detritus: ‚Ä¶Did you just throw a crate at me?Trace: Stoneward won‚Äôt listen to you because he wasn‚Äôt built to serve the estate!
Trace: He was meant to be a gift‚Ä¶ For the birthday.
Trace: For her. I wanted him to be what Nora was for me‚Ä¶
Trace: A childhood friend and loyal guardian.
Detritus: The child.
Detritus: Ours‚Ä¶ Saria‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Yes. That was its purpose.
Detritus: ‚Ä¶But there is no child anymore. Because of Keidran like that, there never will be! If the stone will not obey me, it has no purpose any longer.
Trace: You‚Äôre wrong.
Trace: He does still have a purpose.
Trace: Because this Keidran here is my fianc√©e. And there is still a child!
Detritus: What?!
Stoneward: WARK?Trace: Stoney, now‚Äôs your chance to finally do what you were made for! Protect the child!
Detritus: I‚Ä¶ no! What is this? Lies! Lies!
Detritus: How dare that animal disrespect the memory of Saria by trying to take her place?!
Detritus: How dare you be so naive to believe it?!
Detritus: I will not allow this! I will destroy her! Her, and her illegitimate‚Äí!
SNAP!
Stoneward: RRROOOOAR!
FWOOSH!
Detritus: Aaargh!Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: I see him, father. It is as you forsaw.
Master Seer: Yes. I knew that fool would not pass up an opportunity to use the amulet.
Master Seer: And as anticipated, it only took the smallest push to manipulate him how we needed.
Master Seer: So much ego, greed, and paranoia, it was all too easy. His men‚Ä¶ even his right hand wolf‚Ä¶ and soon, he will join them.
Mage: You‚Äôre playing a dangerous game, Brahn.
Master Seer: Mage.
Mage: Even you can‚Äôt anticipate everything. And we all know you so-called ‚Äúgift‚Äù to foresee the future has never been‚Ä¶ entirely reliable.
Master Seer: Watch your tone. This time is different. This time, I am certain.
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: Oh!
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: ?
BOOM!
Master Seer‚Äôs Daughter: MRRAAA!Natani: Ah!
Keith: What was that?!
Karen: Sounded like it came from the dungeon! Maybe we should go help Miss Reni! (Or at least go watch‚Ä¶)
Madelyn: Are you crazy? What are we supposed to do to help? She‚Äôs a giant fire-breathing lizard, I‚Äôm sure whatever it is, she‚Äôs fine!
BOOM
Reni: GRAH!
Karen & Madelyn: AAAAHHH!!!
Reni: Grawgrle Blarg‚Ä¶
All (off screen): Reni!Reni: URG!
Karen: Reni! Are you okay?! What happened?
Karen: Did you mean to do that? Cause if so, it was awesome!
Reni:
Karen: Uh‚Ä¶ Princess Reni? Hello?
Reni:
Reni: R‚Ä¶Rargh?
Reni: R-rah! Ra Rarerarri! Ra Ren Rarrk! (Wha! My Telepathy! I can‚Äôt talk!)
Karen: Oh! Ra Ra Ra Ra Ra!
Madelyn: Uh, am I not hearing something everyone else is? Why is Miss Reni roaring and not creepily talking in my head like usual?
Raine: ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think she can‚Ä¶!Clovis: (thoughts) I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve done it.
Clovis: (thoughts) Fire from the gods‚Ä¶
Reni: (thoughts) What? Who said that?
Clovis: (thoughts) Oh‚Ä¶ can you hear me? My apologies.
Reni: (thoughts) H-how can you‚Äì?
Clovis: (thoughts) You have my thanks, Dragon. You don‚Äôt know it yet, but you‚Äôre about to help me with an indignity I‚Äôve been working to rectify for a very long time‚Ä¶ You see, the truth is, I didn‚Äôt actually come here today just to get that prisoner of yours.
Clovis: (thoughts) I‚Äôm here for you.Detritus: GRAAHHHHH
Trace: Wow, that actually worked! Good boy, Stoney! You did it!
Stoneward: Wark!
Flora: Is it really dead?
Trace: Come on, let‚Äôs go get Maren out of that thing!
Roselyn: Trace‚Ä¶
Roselyn: After all this time‚Ä¶ Are you really willing to turn your back on Saria?Flora: Trace‚Ä¶
Flora: You humans live such long lives.
Flora: I wish I could too.
Flora: I want to be with you for as much of it as I can. But if something does happen, I hope you know I wouldn‚Äôt want this.
Trace: Flora‚Ä¶
Flora: And I‚Äôm certain Saria wouldn‚Äôt either!
Roselyn: Don‚Äôt speak for him!
Roselyn: How would you know what Saria would have wanted?
Trace: We met her.
Roselyn: You‚Ä¶ w-what?
Trace: Or‚Ä¶ rather, a spirit of her. On our travels, in the place where she died. When we parted ways, she told me she wasn‚Äôt my wife. I only realized later, after Nora explained how she‚Äôd died, that she probably just wanted me to move on.
Roselyn: You‚Ä¶ really saw her?
Trace: I think she was afraid I‚Äôd repeat the same mistakes if I did remember. But I don‚Äôt intend to. I‚Äôm ready to let go, Rose.
Roselyn: If that‚Äôs true‚Ä¶ then you really have changed. ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm relieved. I just wish‚Ä¶ I wish I could have been there to see her too‚Ä¶Roselyn: Ah‚Äì?!
Trace: Sorry. I know I‚Äôm probably the last person in the world you‚Äôd want a hug from. But I am sorry.
Roselyn: . . .
Roselyn: I admit‚Ä¶ this is really weird coming from you‚Ä¶ but thank you.
Trace: Honestly, I half expected to pass right through you.
Roselyn: Heh‚Ä¶ heh-heh‚Ä¶
Roselyn: I think this is the first time I‚Äôve felt anyone since Saria died.
Flora: So‚Ä¶
Flora: Does‚Ä¶ does this mean you‚Äôll help us?
Roselyn: Yes.
Roselyn: I just had to be sure. We both lost Saria that day‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs time to move on.Roselyn: I should be able to free her now‚Ä¶ One moment‚Ä¶
Trace: Huh?
Trace: What‚Äôs going on?
Maren: Eurgh‚Ä¶
Maren: AAAAAH!
Trace: Rose! What are you doing?!
Roselyn: It‚Äôs not me! Detritus already started it! I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt make it stop!Trace:Can we break the crystal?!
Roselyn: Yes, but hurry!
Trace: Stoney!
Trace: We need to get her out of there! Get it open!
Stoneward: Grah!
Detritus: NO!
SHHHINK!Trace: Stoney!
Trace: !!
Trace: Watch out!
SHINK!
Trace: Agh!
Detritus: I will not let Saria down! I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Not again!
Detritus: You cannot stop it now. The process has already started.
Maren: Ah!Flora: Trace! Your hand!
Trace: Ngh! I‚Äôm fine‚Ä¶
Trace: (thoughts) But the moment I drop this shield, he‚Äôll go after Flora again‚Ä¶
Trace: Rose!
Roselyn: There‚Äôs nothing I can do! I have no control over it.
Roselyn: He has direct access to the shackles of my old body.
Roselyn: Through them, he can suppress me and keep himself alive. You must stop him!
Detritus: It‚Äôs too late.
Maren: Huh? Wha-? Where am I?! I-Is that my own body?! What‚Äôs going on?! Help! Someone, help me!
Maren: Ah?!
Detritus: There is no point to fighting anymore.
Detritus: It‚Äôs done. Her soul is gone, and there‚Äôs nothing left that can save her now
CRACK!
CRACK!Maren: (thoughts) Sythe!
Sythe: Ngh!
CRACK!
Sythe: Ergh!
CRASH!
Detritus: No! Saria‚Ä¶
Detritus: Saria‚Ä¶ Taken from me‚Ä¶ by a wolf‚Ä¶ again‚Ä¶?!

THUD
Stoneward: WARK (‚ÄòProtect the Child‚Äô Objective Complete)
Stoneward: WARRRRRRRRR (Shutting Down)Detritus: Saria‚Ä¶ My Saria‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre back‚Ä¶
Detritus: After so long‚Ä¶
Saria: You poor creature. It‚Äôs not your fault you were made to be this way.
Saria: You‚Äôre in so much pain. I‚Äôm sorry.
Detritus: It doesn‚Äôt matter. I did it. I tbought you back‚Ä¶ I finally saved you‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs over‚Ä¶
Detritus: I‚Äôm so‚Ä¶
Detritus: h‚Ä¶a‚Ä¶ppy‚Ä¶Sythe: What have you done to Maren?!
Saria: Ah!
Flora: Sythe, calm down!
Sythe: No, she stole Maren‚Äôs body! Get out of her right now!
Trace: Leave her alone!
Sythe: Shut up, this is your fault! Killing Maren to-
Saria: Wait!
Saria: Please, calm down! I can explain!
Saria: Yes, I‚Ä¶ I am Saria. But this girl I‚Äôm in now‚Ä¶ Maren‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs not gone.
Maren (thoughts): Ah?! W-who‚Ä¶?
Saria (thoughts): Don‚Äôt worry‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt let you go.
Saria (caption): I couldn‚Äôt stop the magic from pulling me into her body, but I held on to her.
Saria: Still, it‚Äôs a good thing you broke the crystal when you did. I‚Äôm not sure how long I could keep her here.
Sythe: So, this‚Ä¶ possession thing‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not permanent‚Ä¶ is it?
Saria: No. It was thankfully stopped in time.
Saria: I have no intention of stealing this poor girl‚Äôs body. I‚Äôve already lived my life, and Maren deserves to have hers. You will have her back. I promise.Trace: Saria!
Trace: Is that really all you have to say? After all this time‚Ä¶ all I did for you?
Trace: Did what we have together mean anything to you?
Saria: Of course it did. I loved my Trace. I wish dearly we could have had more time together.
Saria: But you‚Äôre not him.
Saria: My Trace died the day I did, trying to bring me back the first time‚Ä¶
Saria: ‚Ä¶his mind poisoned by black magic in process. Only to be purified once his memories were wiped away.
Trace: No! I‚Äôm still here! I can save you! I can find a new body, just stay with me for now! Saria!
Saria: I‚Äôm sorry. My time in this world is over, as is yours.
Saria: Please‚Ä¶ stop this. Let me go, I beg you. As my dying wish‚Ä¶
Saria: Let your new self be happy‚Ä¶ Set things right‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace? Trace?!Flora: Trace?! Are you still in there?
Trace: Flora, you‚Äôre smooshing my face‚Ä¶
Flora: Trace! You had a scary look for a minute. I thought other you was going crazy again!
Trace: No, I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fine, Flora. Strangely, I feel better than ever.
Trace: Huh?
Saria: Oh. It seems my time here is growing close to an end.
Saria: I won‚Äôt resist it, though I feel I could. This girl‚Ä¶ Maren‚Ä¶ she will be changed as it is. I won‚Äôt risk more.
Trace: Saria, I heard what you said to‚Ä¶ me. I promise, I will do everything I can to make things right again‚Ä¶
Saria: Thank you‚Ä¶ I have faith you‚Äôll do better this time. I wish you both well. But before I go, there‚Äôs one last thing‚Ä¶
Saria: Rose‚Ä¶ I can still sense that you‚Äôre here.
Saria: Are you really going to let me leave without saying anything?Roselyn: ‚Ä¶Saria‚Ä¶
Saria: My beautiful Rose‚Ä¶ you look so young! I haven‚Äôt seen you like this in a long time.
Roselyn: This‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt my real body.
Saria: I know. This isn‚Äôt mine either.

Keiren: I‚Ä¶ see.
Keiren: Well, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not upset. If you‚Äôll excuse me, I need to make a report.
I understand. Good day, captain.
