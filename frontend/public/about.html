<h1 id="tk-codex">TK Codex</h1>
<p>Hi! i see you found my small database I made for <a href="https://twokinds.keenspot.com">Twokinds</a> the comic by Tom Fischbach. I made thid because in general it is very hard to try to look for anything specific in the comic pages itself, this small website allows you to search per character and per textual dialogue.</p>
<p>This by no means try to replace the excellent <a href="https://2ks.wogcodex.com">Codex Mr Amenon</a> did. Go check that out it is very cool! Mine lacks features like negative searches and aliases. Moreover Amenons codex indexed panel content by hand something mine does not.</p>
<p>Main difference with Amenons work is this thing is up to date with the comic and has, or should have, some features to keep it automatically in sync whenever a new page comes out. Finally it is completely open source so you can host your own and or use it for whatever reason.</p>
<p>This is first an exercise for me to learn some web development, you can tell i know nothing of css, and second combining something of my work on twokinds data into something usable for all.</p>
<p>Again my final objective with this is for people to have some way to quickly crossreference information on the comic. Hope you find this useful and at least half as interesting as I did making it.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>You get 3 searches Art, Text and Dialogue: Art deals with characters on scene, currently only talking characters are matched, so for example, Dahlia bodyguard is not indexed since she never speaks. May update manually over time for these cases but in most of the cases is not a very big limitation</p>
<p>To use it simply add a space separated list of every character, then system will then fetch all pages where ALL the characters in the list appear, case insensitive. for example the query:</p>
<pre><code>Natani Laura Trace</code></pre>
<p>Yields the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>211, 2005-08-03, Comic for August 3, 2005</li>
<li>430, 2008-02-27, Comic for February 27, 2008</li>
<li>752, 2013-08-04, Comic for August 4, 2013</li>
<li>756, 2013-09-08, Comic for September 8, 2013</li>
<li>757, 2013-09-17, Comic for September 17, 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>For textual search the system will fetch everything that matches the exact string you put there for example:</p>
<pre><code>25,000</code></pre>
<p>Returns:</p>
<ul>
<li>256, 2006-04-24, Comic for April 24, 2006</li>
</ul>
<p>Dialogue query means to use both inputs to search for any text limited to the characters. In other words it allows you to search for a specific line of text spoken by one or more characters. You do need to use both field and hit the Dialogue Query button at the button</p>
<p>For example the query with Art set to:</p>
<pre><code>stoneward</code></pre>
<p>And text as:</p>
<pre><code>child</code></pre>
<p>Returns</p>
<ul>
<li>1171, 2022-04-16, Comic for April 16, 2022: Purpose</li>
</ul>
<p>Just for clarity output is a list and the header is as it follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page number, Release Date, Comic Title (Most early comics used release date as titles)</li>
</ul>
<p>And that is pretty much it, there are plans to add more features in the future but at least what there is here should be functional</p>
