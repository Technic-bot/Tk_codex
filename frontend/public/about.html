<h1>About this Codex</h1>
  <p> Hello folks! 
  I see you have landed in my tiny codex.
  This is intended as a way to quickly search for art and the contents of the comic.
  Pretty much like he excellent <a href=https://2ks.wogcodex.com/> Tk Codex by Amenon </a>
  </p>
  <p>This is by no means intends to replace Amenon work, functionality is not as extensive 
  as his site, but this is an open source project meaning anyone other than me can 
  host it, it also has some features that allow it to be automatically up to date. 
  You can check the project  <a href=https://github.com/Technic-bot/Tk_codex>https://github.com/Technic-bot/Tk_codex </a> for cloning and other details.

<div class="usage">
  <p> Relatively simple, you have 2 options art search for characters and text search for textual searches. First one simple add a space separated list of the characters you want to see: <p>
  <div class="example">
    <p> Natani Flora Keith </p>
  </div>
  <p> The  other simply add textual search, search is not stemmed so you need to be textual on what you want: <p>
  <div class="example">
    <p>But that magicâ€™s forbidden!</p>
  </div>
  <p> you do not need to respect capitalization though all search is done on lowercase characters</p>
